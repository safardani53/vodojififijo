Oh boy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>"I was upset that you’re old enough to be her dad," Tiffany explained, understating the situation.</p><p>"I was just like, ‘What are you doing?’ 23? I’m 29!" she expressed.</p><p>Tiffany very fairly asked: "What do you have in common with her?"</p><p>"It was hard," she lamented. "Because you were blowing me off and essentially saying, ‘F you, I don’t give a sh*t. I’m just gonna do whatever.’"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>"I was selfish and I’m sorry," Ed blubbered.</p><p>"One thing that I definitely want you to know," he affirmed to his daughter, "is that you were and are and have always been the love of my life."</p><p>"And we have such a great foundation," Ed pointed out.</p><p>"And," he admitted, "I did realize, ‘Wow, I just probably flushed that all down the toilet.’"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"And that’s what scared me the most,” Ed expressed.</p><p>“But, for what it’s worth," he told Tiffany, "I’m sorry for not listening, you know, to you."</p><p>"And," Ed added, "the fact that I hurt you."</p><p>They hugged and made up. Many months later, the Tell All was filmed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>At the Tell All, it was more than simply apparent that Big Ed and Rosemarie Vega had, as we all suspected and hoped, broken up.</p><p>Clearly, Rose was still harboring some understandable bitter feelings.</p><p>After all, this was the man who had humiliated on television after leading her on for months with lies.</p><p>But Ed, too, had a bone to pick.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Ed has been eating up every PR opportunity that came his way for months, spinning his side of the story.</p><p>Though he is hardly<a href=#> the most authentic star in 90 Day Fiance history</a> as he has claimed, he is certainly a breakout star.</p><p>Big Ed has become a meme so popular that his image pops up on social media accounts of people who’ve never watched the show.</p><p>But Rosemarie says that the real Ed is gross and exploitative.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Rose described an example of that, recalling an incident in which she emotionally told Ed about her personal struggles at the time.</p><p>Ed’s response, Rosemarie describes, was to ask her to make a sex video for him.</p><p>Apparently, he offered to pay her to take off her clothes on camera for him.</p><p>While there’s nothing wrong with any kind of sex work, including cam work, asking a distressed person to do that for you is unacceptable.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>That is not all.</p><p>Rose says that Big Ed tried to hit her up to get back together earlier that year, either out of horniness or a desire to save his image.</p><p>Ed fired back, claiming that Rose had begged for him to take her back in early February, asking for a Valentine’s Day present.</p><p>He even held up what he claimed were screenshots of photos that Rose had sent him. Curiously, they look like stills from an Instagram video.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>But regardless, Ed did admit that he considered dating Rosemarie again.</p><p>That was when host Shaun Robinson revealed that Ed’s daughter, Tiffany, had been listening the entire time.</p><p>She asked Tiffany how it felt to hear her father admit that he was prepared to discard his relationship with her a second time.</p><p>Tiffany was silent for a few moments … and understandably burst into tears.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>At this point, Ed either cries or pretends to cry while his adult daughter expresses the emotional pain that he has once again put her through.</p><p>It was a painful moment for the audience.</p><p>Ed once again falls back on his "sorry, I’m dumb, I’m an idiot, etc" schtick that has probably let him weasel his way out of trouble too many times.</p><p>At some point, you have to deliberately choose to prioritize the emotional health of your loved ones. It doesn’t matter how "dumb" you are.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Big Ed also revealed that the only reason that he did not decide to get back with Rosemarie was that she was dating again.</p><p>Rose did date an unnamed woman after her breakup with Ed, out of a desire to move on.</p><p>Ideally, to move on with someone who won’t lie to her or shame her for having hair on her human body.</p><p>Rose is no longer dating that woman, but we are relieved that she moved on from Big Ed just the same.</p><a href=#><h2
