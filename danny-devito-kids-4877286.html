After making his movie debut in 1970, Danny, 77, has starred in a number of <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>critically-acclaimed films</a>, as well as popular TV shows and theater. He’s incredibly versatile as an actor. He’s starred in major movies like&nbsp;One Flew Over The Cuckoo’s Nest&nbsp;and received a Best Picture Oscar nomination for Erin Brockovich.&nbsp;Still to some, he’s most known as the Penguin in&nbsp;Batman Returns&nbsp;or the voice of Phil in&nbsp;Hercules. His comedic abilities have also earned him much recognition. He won an Emmy for his comedy series&nbsp;Taxi and to many fans he’s Frank Reynolds on It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Danny-Devitos-kids-shutter-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>During his time on Broadway, Danny met his wife&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Rhea Perlman</a>,&nbsp;</strong>74, and the pair got married in 1982. The couple had three children in the 80s. After 35 years of marriage, the pair announced they were <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>separating in 2017,</a> but they haven’t finalized their divorce. Despite the split, it seems like the former couple are still friends and are great parents to their adult children.

The couple’s oldest daughter filed in her parents’ footsteps and became an actress. She’s really taken after both of them and performed in theater, movies, and TV. “They’re amazing parents, and they’re in the spotlight of course, and everyone knows who they are, but they’re very down-to-earth people,” she said on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Rich Eisen Show</a>&nbsp;in August 2022. She said she had early memories of fans asking her parents for pictures and visiting them on set.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>After graduating from Brown University with a theater degree, she played&nbsp;<strong>Anne Frank&nbsp;</strong>in a play in 2008, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Seattle Times.</a>&nbsp;Before she graduated, she had a few minor acting credits, including on her dad’s show&nbsp;It’s Always Sunny In Philadelphia,&nbsp;appearing on three episodes, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>IMDb</a>.&nbsp;She has starred alongside her dad on a few occasions, even playing his character’s daughter in the 2016 film&nbsp;The Comedian.&nbsp;They also both lent their voices to the 2022 animated comedy&nbsp;Little Demon. Despite working alongside her dad on plenty of occasions, she’s made a number of appearances on her own, including films like&nbsp;Leaves of Grass and TV shows like&nbsp;The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.&nbsp;</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Danny admitted that he loved working with his daughter during an August 2022 interview about&nbsp;Little Demon on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Today</a>. “I just adore working with Lucy. We’ve been working together since she was this big,” he said with a laugh. Lucy also said that they “have a really fun time”<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> working together.</a></p><h2>Grace Fan DeVito</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Danny-Devitos-kids-shutter-embed-4.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>Danny and his wife welcomed their second daughter&nbsp;<strong>Grace,&nbsp;</strong>37, in March 1985. Of the three children, Grace is the most private, but she has also dabbled in entertainment. She was a producer for the 2006 comedy&nbsp;My Girlfriend’s Abroad,&nbsp;and she also acted in the 2015 movie&nbsp;Amboy&nbsp;as well as an episode of the 2017 animated show Jeff And Some Aliens,&nbsp;per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>IMDb</a>. Even though she’s very private, she has occasionally accompanied her family to red-carpet events and had family members share photos of her on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a>.</p><h2>Jake Daniel DeVito</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Danny-Devitos-kids-shutter-embed-3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8>Danny and Rhea had their only son&nbsp;<strong>Jake,&nbsp;</strong>35, in October 1987. While his family is very famous, he admitted that the kids didn’t let fame get to them. “They were really good about keeping our home really solid and safe. I always feel like we always were more just excited about being at home with our friends and in our community,” Jake said in a March 2022 interview with <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Associated Press</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Jake also works in the entertainment business, but most of his work is offscreen. He’s been a producer on a number of projects, including the 2014 movie&nbsp;The Better Angels&nbsp;and the upcoming thriller&nbsp;St. Sebastian, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>IMDb</a>. Still one of his most notable projects is working alongside his dad and sister on the&nbsp;Little Demon&nbsp;animated series, which he’s an executive producer for, making it a true family affair.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8OapaexXZmyt7XTqGSkoZSoenWElnBpcW5f</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdanny-devito-kids-4877286.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdanny-devito-kids-4877286.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdanny-devito-kids-4877286.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdanny-devito-kids-4877286.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdanny-devito-kids-4877286.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdanny-devito-kids-4877286.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./pamela-long.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./pamela-long.html>Fame | Pamela Long net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./cristiano-ronaldo-38-ripped-abs-saudi-winter-break.html>Cristiano Ronaldo, 38, shows off ripped abs as he enjoys topless gym session during Saudi leagues</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./cristiano-ronaldo-38-ripped-abs-saudi-winter-break.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
