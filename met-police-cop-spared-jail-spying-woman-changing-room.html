I never would have thought I wouldn't be the woman I was before entering that changing room.</p><p>"I still to this day am struggling to come to terms with what had happened.</p><p>"Growing up, I was taught that the police were the first point of call in an emergency.</p><p>"To learn that a police officer has put me in danger, completely violating me by recording me on his mobile phone for his own sexual gratification is unfathomable.</p><p>"How do I begin to erase the trauma that his police officer has caused?"</p><h2>'DISTURBING'</h2><p>Handing him a suspended sentence, Judge Anne Brown said: 'We've heard the victim's statement and the very serious impact this offence has had upon her and on her life.&nbsp;</p><p>"It was a nasty and disturbing offence and did in my judgement show a degree of planning on your behalf, you were some 15 minutes in that changing room.</p><p>"It has clearly left the victim with a deep sense of personal violation and fear."</p><p>She added: "As a police officer at the time, the public would have rightly expected you to have a strong sense of duty, to protect the public from criminal behaviour and to be someone who sought above all to uphold the law.</p><p>"You brought shame on yourself, your family and the police service that you represented by what you did."</p><p>Commander Kyle Gordon, who leads the Met's Taskforce, branded Chaudhry's behaviour as "repugnant", the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">BBC</a> reports.</p><p>He said: "His actions go against everything we stand for.</p><p>"Holding the office of constable is a privilege and it comes with great responsibility.</p><p>"He showed himself to be totally unsuitable to hold this office and undeserving of the trust of the public, and it is right that he has resigned."</p><p>Choudhury, who has already served 16 weeks in custody, was handed at 10-month sentence, suspended for 18 months.</p><p>He must also complete a rehabilitation activity requirement for 35 days, and attend the Horizon programme for sex offenders for 27 days and complete 120 hours of unpaid work.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ

for 10 years and has been the made of a subject of sexual notification requirement.</p><p>One of the conditions is he may not use unisex changing rooms for the next 10 years.</p><p class=postsid
