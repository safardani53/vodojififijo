Centurion Vi22</h3><p>Speaking of sleekness and style here, the Centurion Vi22 is <a href=# rel=noopener>top on </a>many people’s lists. Centurion is best known for its deadrise (the waves you find in an ocean).</p><p>It has lower gun waves in addition to the built-in wave/wake-maker, which delivers an impressive 20 degrees of deadrise, including its stunning good looks and convenient transom storage.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/The-2023-Centurion-Vi22-All-Set-To-Glide-Through-The-Waves-Source-Boat-Trader.jpg><p>Furthermore, the boat’s cruising speed is the hottest in town, thanks to on-the-fly adjustments to the Stinger Wake Plate.</p><p>While it can seat around 12 people and has a fuel capacity of 63 gallons, the boat may not perform well on choppy waters, despite producing remarkably symmetrical waves.</p><p>Nonetheless, it is ranked as the best boat for deadrise for a reason – the Opti-V hull provides exceptional performance. At the same time, the raw power delivered by the PCM409 engine is equally impressive.</p><h3>3. 231SL From Sanger</h3><p>Whether you’re a beginner or a pro, the Sanger 231SL’s powerful surf system creates a perfectly-shaped wake that makes it easy to surf, wakeboard, or even ski.</p><p>While it has ample room aboard, that’s characteristic of a size boat; it handles like a much smaller boat.</p><p>Talking about its size, it fits about 16 people while being comfortable, picks up speed remarkably fast, and cranks into turns.</p><p>The Sanger uses a 900-pound flash flood wake system to generate a deadrise on each side.</p><p>It’s pro and customizable, with a fuel capacity of 70 gallons, and also gives two engine options: the Indmar Raptor 440 or The Indmar Raptor 575; the choice is yours.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Wakeboarding-From-Sanger-231SL-683x1024.jpg><p>Furthermore, its standard features include a full-length stringer, adjustable driver’s seat, seat bass, bow storage, tilt steering, automatic bilge pump, and a deluxe upholstery package.</p><p>The downside is we can’t use that boat for anything other than skiing and wakeboarding, but the lifetime warranty on the hull probably makes up for it, right?</p><h3>4. 2020 Moomba Kaiyen</h3><p>We all would love a low-budget but perfect boat, don’t we? The 2020 Moomba Kaiyen can accommodate up to 15 people at a go while including a 6.2L Ford Raptor engine generating 400 hp at its finest.</p><p>It has a non-skid walk-through transom design, although a 7-inch dashboard display, a wireless phone charging pad, GPS mapping, and an exquisite interior.</p><p>Not only is it the most affordable wakeboard boat model, but it also has excellent handling in tight docking situations.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2020-Moomba-Kaiyen-1-683x1024.jpg><p>With comfortable seating arrangements and ample storage space, the boat is also practical for long days on the water with family and friends.</p><p>In addition, with a fuel capacity of 45 gallons, it has excellent fuel economy and handling.</p><p>Even though it’s not ideal for offshore use on choppy waters, we would want it just for the excellent value for my money.</p><h3>5. 2020 Centurion Vi24</h3><p>Meet the 2020 Centurion Vi24; stability is its middle name. The Vi24 has Quick Surf and Stinger Wake Plate tabs that allow you to tweak and tune the waves and wake generated by the boat while still in motion.</p><p>In addition, it’s built on an Opti-V hull, making it one of the most stable crafts around.</p><p>With a fuel capacity of about 63 gallons, it uses PCM 450 HO engine in addition to the three plugs and plays bags in the bow, which gives unmatched stability while cruising the water.</p><p>This makes it an excellent choice for watersports enthusiasts looking for a thrilling underwater experience.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/The-2020-Centurion-Vi24-In-Blue-White-Combo-683x1024.jpg><p>Moreover, in addition to its impressive technology features, the 2020 Centurion Vi-24 also boasts comfortable and customizable seating that can accommodate up to 14 people. The boat’s storage is also well thought out and easily accessible, while a Rosewell audio system ensures that the tunes keep pumping throughout your time on the water.</p><p>The dash screens look slightly outdated, but why would you even need the dash screens when you’re enjoying wake surfing?</p><h3>6. 2020 Wake Setter 23 MXZ</h3><p>For all the techy ones, here’s a tech favorite: The new 2020 Wake setter 23 MXZ from <a href=# rel=noopener>Malibu boats</a>.
