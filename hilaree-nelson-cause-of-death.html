Nelson was 49 years old, and her husband, Jim Morrison, who was also her climbing partner, confirmed the news that his wife had died. Following the news, many wanted to know more about Hilaree's death, including its cause.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What was Hilaree Nelson's cause of death?</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The New York Times</a>, Nelson died in an avalanche. That avalanche came while she and Jim were in Nepal summitting the peak of Manaslu. That peak is more than 25,000 feet above sea level, and Hilaree and Jim both made it to the top safely. Once they reached the peak, they both strapped on the skis that they had carried to the top and began to make their way back down.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>Hilaree was swept off her feet by a small avalanche shortly thereafter. Jim wasn't caught up in the same avalanche, but there was nothing he could do as he watched his wife fly down the mountain. Search efforts commenced immediately, but a full search and rescue operation was delayed by poor weather. Hilaree's body was found much further down the mountain than where she had been swept off her feet.</p><p>Hilaree's body was found after two days of searching, and it appeared as though the avalanche had blown her off of a cliff and onto the south face of the mountain.</p><p>“My loss is indescribable and I am focused on her children and their steps forward,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jim wrote on Instagram</a>. “Hilaree Nelson is the most inspiring person in life and now her energy will guide our collective souls.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Hilaree Nelson's funeral took place in Kathmandu.</h2><p>In the traditional Nepalese funeral, the skier's body was covered with flowers and scarves, placed on wood, and burned on a pyre lit by Buddhists monks.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CBS News</a>, friends, family, government officials, and mountaineers were in attendance. Mourners lit incense as music played.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who was Hilaree Nelson's first husband?</h2><p>Hilaree had two children, Graydon and Quinn, who are now both teenagers. Both sons are from her first marriage to Brian O'Neill, a heliguide to whom she was married for 14 years. Brian has kept a much lower profile than his ex-wife in the years since their divorce.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Jim Morrison (@jimwmorrison)</a></p><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Hilaree Nelson was a legendary climber.</h2><p>Following the confirmation of her death, tributes began pouring out for Hilaree, who was one of the defining athletes in her sport. One of her defining accomplishments was scaling Mount Everest and then the neighboring Lhotse, the fourth highest peak in the world, in a 24-hour period in 2012.</p><p>“She was equal to men,” Conrad Anker, an occasional expedition partner told The New York Times after her death. “She was there with the strongest men, an equal to Jim. In that sense, her ability to take on gender perceptions was pretty remarkable.”</p><p>Hilaree was also characterized by her patience, and was known to set her sights on a potential expedition and then wait years to find the right time to complete it. In the dangerous world of mountain expeditions, tomorrow is never guaranteed. Hilaree's legacy will live on, and she will be remembered as one of the sport's pioneers.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnbatrdGenGamlaHAsLqMnJiuq5VivKd5w56YraA%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhilaree-nelson-cause-of-death.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhilaree-nelson-cause-of-death.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhilaree-nelson-cause-of-death.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhilaree-nelson-cause-of-death.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhilaree-nelson-cause-of-death.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhilaree-nelson-cause-of-death.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./nmhgmgs-jildcdt3av1ottkxnmrflgtc.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./nmhgmgs-jildcdt3av1ottkxnmrflgtc.html>Stream Movies, Shows &amp;amp; Live TV</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./narada-michael-walden.html>Narada Michael Walden</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./narada-michael-walden.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
