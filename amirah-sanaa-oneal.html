Her love for basketball started when she was still a very young kid who lived in a house full of greatness.</p><p>She started training and going with her father to see him play during the last stages of his career. Her being the second eldest sibling to go into basketball with her brother Shareef wasn’t that easy for them based on what their father already achieved.</p><p>The spotlight was always on them to deliver despite knowing they still have a long way to go in their careers.

She has also earned an All-CIF callup four times, All-Gold Coast League, which she has received three times, and All-State twice already in her career.</p><p>She is building something good just as expected of her while still working on the road to becoming a professional.
