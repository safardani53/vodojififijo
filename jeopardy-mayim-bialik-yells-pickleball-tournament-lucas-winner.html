I guess she's a pickleball fan?"</p><p>A third replied: "Mayim’s thoughts on various sports, a saga -She is very enthusiastic about pickleball - [and] she finds curling funny looking."</p><p>"Just heard this part of the show... I was like 'damn Mayim really likes Pickleball'" wrote a fourth.</p><p>And a fifth defended: "I'm generally not a fan but I really loved that, it felt like the rare time where her personality actually came through for whatever reason."</p><p>Last week, <a href=#>Mayim had to stop in her tracks to chuckle</a> over a clue looking for "curling."</p><p>The&nbsp;<a href=#>video clue</a>&nbsp;under "It's great to 'CU'" showed athletes on ice.</p><p>"Grab a broom! It's the sport being played here," Mayim said as the video ran and she started laughing, barely getting the words out.</p><p>"What is: Curling?" a student correctly responded looking less humored.</p><p>Gasping for breath and gripping the host podium, the actress needed a second and eventually told the mum in-studio audience: "That's correct, it just makes me laugh every time I see it!"</p><p>One fan wrote on Reddit: "Not sure anyone has ever found the concept of Curling as funny as Mayim"</p><p>So far the semi-finalists of ongoing tournament are Lucas, 2018 Teen Tournament winner <a href=#>Claire Sattler,</a>&nbsp;<a href=#>Jackson Jones</a>, 2019 Teen Tournament winner <a href=#>Avi Gupta</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>Brown freshman Justin Bolsen</a>&nbsp;who became a fan-favorite with a bold Daily Double bet last Wednesday, and&nbsp;<a href=#>Maya Wright</a>, a senior at Emory.</p><p>The semi-finals will begin later this week as the students are dismissed and until three remain for a two-day total point affair finals.</p><h2>'STOP TRYING TO MAKE MAYIM HAPPEN'</h2><p>The <a href=#>Jeopardy!</a> hosting schedule for the rest of the season was announced on Monday’s&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Inside Jeopardy!” podcast</a>&nbsp;— and viewers are <a href=#>upset about the decision-making.</a></p><p>“Ken Jennings will be back on March 10, and then he will continue the rest of his syndicated run, which will take us through April 28,” producer Sarah Foss shared. “Then Mayim [Bialik] will take over on May 1, and she’ll take us all the way through the summer.”</p><p>Following the reunion tournament, Ken will return from March 10 through April 28.</p><p>After that, he seemingly won’t be back as host of the syndicated episodes until September 2023.</p><p>Fans of the treasured <a href=#>game show</a> responded to the scheduling news in fury when it was posted by the&nbsp;Twitter account&nbsp;“Is Ken Jennings Hosting Jeopardy! This Week?”</p><p>“Great! I’ll put it in my calendar for when I can resume watching Jeopardy again,” one user slammed.</p><p>“I want Ken full time … I don’t understand why they have the switch-a-roo thing. Why can’t Ken be the whole regular season?”&nbsp;another vented.</p><p>“Keep Ken! For crying out loud he is a natural host. Mayim play-acts host and it is annoying. Let her host celebrity shows,”&nbsp;a third argued.</p><p>“Jeopardy, stop trying to make Mayim happen. It’s not going to happen,”&nbsp;a fourth joked.</p><p>“Can we for the love of god just have Mayim host Celebrity Jeopardy! One of the contestants even admitted that her pacing and the way she reads the clues is just plain bad. There’s literally no reason why she should be hosting syndicated,”&nbsp;a sixth even said -referring to recent player <a href=#>Jake DeArruda who slammed Mayim as "inconsistent."</a></p><p>Last week marked the first time Mayim has hosted regular episodes this season instead of&nbsp;<a href=#>Ken Jennings</a>, 48 - she has only hosted <a href=#>Celebrity Jeopardy!</a> which wrapped Feb. 2.</p><p>Fans have made it no secret that it's been an adjustment, as the former 74-time champ lives and breathes&nbsp;Jeopardy!.</p><p>Outlets have gone as far as to run&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">headlines</a>&nbsp;like: "Mayim Bialik Is Almost Universally Despised As Jeopardy! Host."</p><p>One quantifiable issue is&nbsp;<a href=#>Mayim's cadence; namely, her pause when deeming a contestant correct</a>&nbsp;or not on nearly every clue.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Many fans have agreed she is doing a "serviceable job" on specials like Celebrity Jeopardy compared to the buzzer-fast regular show and a former champion recently told&nbsp;<a href=#>The U.S. Sun she should stick to that.</a></p><p>Ken will not be gone for good - he will host the primetime series <a href=#>Jeopardy! Masters </a>on ABC, which <a href=#>features six fan-favorites</a> competing over 10 hour-long episodes this spring.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/02/host-mayim-bialik-alarms-fans-799342140.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/02/host-mayim-bialik-stops-game-797789735-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/02/math-jeopardy-s-ken-jennings-795782909-2.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hvZWaBenySaKGep6CWv6XFjKaYsqGdYq%2BqrcuiomaxlaG5tHnPopqkpJWXrq24jK2mrqqelrqmutNmo66bkah6uLXNp5yrZw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjeopardy-mayim-bialik-yells-pickleball-tournament-lucas-winner.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjeopardy-mayim-bialik-yells-pickleball-tournament-lucas-winner.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjeopardy-mayim-bialik-yells-pickleball-tournament-lucas-winner.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjeopardy-mayim-bialik-yells-pickleball-tournament-lucas-winner.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjeopardy-mayim-bialik-yells-pickleball-tournament-lucas-winner.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjeopardy-mayim-bialik-yells-pickleball-tournament-lucas-winner.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./marty-feldman.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./marty-feldman.html>Marty Feldman</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./dan-bilzerian-asks-cop-for-gun-during-vegas-shooting-in-insane-v.html>Dan Bilzerian Asks Cop For Gun During Vegas Shooting in Insane Video</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./dan-bilzerian-asks-cop-for-gun-during-vegas-shooting-in-insane-v.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
