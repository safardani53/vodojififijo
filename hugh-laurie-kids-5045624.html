However, in real life, he is a loving father of two sons and one daughter he shares with his <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>wife of three decades</a>, <strong>Jo Green</strong>. Read on to learn about Hugh Laurie’s kids below.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/hugh-laurie-kids-ss-embed1.jpg><h2>Hugh Laurie Has Three Kids</h2><p id=content-paragraph-3>Hugh and Jo first welcomed a son named <strong>Charlie</strong> into the world in 1988 — one year before they were married. They then welcomed their second son, <strong>Bill</strong>, in 1991, and finally, their daughter, <strong>Rebecca</strong>, in 1992. Laurie’s entire family has remained out of the spotlight aside from the occasional public appearances from him and Jo. Rebecca acted in one film when she was a young child, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>IMDb</a>, but that was the beginning and end of her acting career.</p><h2>What Has Hugh Said About His Kids?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>Hugh once spoke about the struggles he faced being away from his<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> three children</a> as he was across the pond in America filming for House. “It’s a very difficult thing [being so far from my kids],” he told the<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Daily Record</a> in 2012, noting that his morning is nighttime for his beloved kids, making it difficult to connect.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>“I constantly marvel at how grown-up my children are, how grown-up they’re being about this,” he continued.&nbsp;“I worry about parenting at this sort of distance, but they are being so generous and so cool about it that. I mean, it might be because they’re English, and they won’t reveal their psychological damage until they’re in their late forties.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/hugh-laurie-wife-spl-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>As for his visiting schedule, he said he would visit his kids whenever he had the chance. “If we get Thanksgiving off in November, I got four days to go back. I go when I can. There’s just a lot of flying,” he explained.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Hugh also admitted he never expected that he would be part of a long-distance family because he was certain the show would get canceled. <span>“In fact, the first season I was in a hotel for the first three months because I was so convinced that we were going to be gone,” he confessed.&nbsp;</span>“I didn’t even unpack. I had a half-empty suitcase. I thought it was going to be any day now.” At the time of the interview, he confirmed he had an apartment his children were welcome at whenever they could make it there.</p><h2>How Did Hugh’s Marriage Survive?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>Although Hugh seemingly had his frustrations about the double life he lived, he knew it was just what came with the job. “I wouldn’t say that doing the series has made my marriage easier. Better? I don’t know about that either,” he told the<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Daily Mail</a> in 2010. “Doing weekly TV is like joining the Navy and going on the other side of the world for ten months of the year,” he added.&nbsp;“But the truth is that whatever challenging situation you’re in, somebody somewhere has got a much more extreme version. So I think one ought to shut up and not moan about it.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8eunqFlnJbCs7XEZqKinKNignGAlG9pbWc%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhugh-laurie-kids-5045624.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhugh-laurie-kids-5045624.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhugh-laurie-kids-5045624.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhugh-laurie-kids-5045624.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhugh-laurie-kids-5045624.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhugh-laurie-kids-5045624.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./michael-b-jordans-dating-history-lori-harvey-kendall-jenner-more.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./michael-b-jordans-dating-history-lori-harvey-kendall-jenner-more.html>Michael B.
