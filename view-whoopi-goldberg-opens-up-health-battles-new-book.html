Hecht, was released on Tuesday.</p><p>In it, she recounted many stories in her life and got candid about her recent <a href=#>health</a> struggles.</p><p>"I had no idea how many annoying little things would start to happen to my body as I aged," <a href=#>the View</a> host wrote.</p><p>The 66-year-old went on to say that when she stands, her knees make so much noise that it sounds like they are playing clackers.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE WHOOPI GOLDBERG">READ MORE WHOOPI GOLDBERG</h2><p>Whoopi wrote that she has never ached in her life as much as she does now and therefore, knows when it is going to rain.</p><p>At one point, <a href=#>Whoopi</a> thought she "left her coccyx on the chair" after getting up.</p><p>"I think, Did I just break something? Is something wrong here? Should I be sounding like this? Apparently, yes, I should," she explained.</p><p>Whoopi then told readers that she has a "touch of Arthritis."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>"Moving my neck around, moving my shoulders, I have bursitis. I mean, I have a lot of ‘itises.’”</p><p>The host then went on to explain that a few years ago she had a bad cough that lasted nearly a year, so she finally went to the doctors.</p><p>"And the day of You Know Who’s second State of the Union address, I started thinking, Boy, I really don’t feel good, and this can’t just be because I don’t like him. So, I called my trusty sidekick, who was in the city, and said, ‘Hey, I’m not feeling good,'" she wrote.</p><p>Whoopi then explained, after an ambulance was called, that she was being kept in the <a href=#>hospital</a> and was told she had pneumonia in both of her lungs and was septic, which is a possibly life-threatening condition that results from the body's response to an infection.</p><p>The host had her lungs drained and spent a month in the hospital.</p><h2>WHOOPI'S ADVICE</h2><p>She then offered advice for her readers about taking care of their health.</p><p>“So, if you’re not feeling well, don’t fool around. Had I reached out to my friends or a doctor about that cough after two or three months, I might have saved myself the year and a half recovery.”</p><p>Whoopi also wrote that sometimes your body tells on you, but you have to listen and take care of it.</p><p>"Your body is your best friend. It tells you everything, so listen to it."</p><p>And although Whoopi's symptoms were pretty clear-cut, she also warned her readers that it is always good to get a second opinion.</p><h2>'BE RIDICULOUS'</h2><p>In another chapter, Whoopi opened up about why <a href=#>she "acts ridiculous" sometimes</a>."</p><p>The actress also explained the 24/30 rule that helps her live a more positive life.</p><p>"There's enough time - there's twenty-four hours for goodness' sake -for you to get all angry at whoever or whatever," she wrote.</p><p>"But you gotta take at least half an hour to just be ridiculous inside your own mind. Be as ridiculous as you want to be."</p><p>Whoopi continued: "Listen, there is enough stress to last you day in and day out, so why not say, 'You know what? I'm going to fart every twenty feet I go.'"</p><p>"Say it in your head and if it makes you laugh, that's a good thing," she ended.</p><h2>WHOOPI THE AUTHOR</h2><p>Two Old Broads is not the first book that Whoopi has written.</p><p>She has written fictional <a href=#>children's</a> books called the Sugar Plum Ballerinas series.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>But the host has revealed a lot more about her life and her opinions in the biographical novels she has released.</p><p>Is It Just Me? Or Is It Nuts Out There?, If Someone Says "You Complete Me," Run, and The Unqualified Hostess: I Do It My Way So You Can Too! are just some of the titles.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/11/whoopi-goldberg-discusses-book-two-773939610.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/11/2022-suspended-talk-show-hosts-708817531.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/11/whoopi-goldberg-attends-premiere-till-773636865.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2huZmh%2BcoOUaK2inadixKm7zqmgZp%2BfobGjsdGgZKiolaPAbsHPZp%2BemZyptW6uwK2rpZ2jYrumw4ybpqijXw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fview-whoopi-goldberg-opens-up-health-battles-new-book.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fview-whoopi-goldberg-opens-up-health-battles-new-book.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fview-whoopi-goldberg-opens-up-health-battles-new-book.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fview-whoopi-goldberg-opens-up-health-battles-new-book.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fview-whoopi-goldberg-opens-up-health-battles-new-book.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fview-whoopi-goldberg-opens-up-health-battles-new-book.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./beau-biden-19690203-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./beau-biden-19690203-html.html>Beau Biden (Politician) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./terry-mcdermott-i-want-to-know-what-love-is-the-voice.html>Terry McDermott - I Want to Know What Love Is (The Voice)</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./terry-mcdermott-i-want-to-know-what-love-is-the-voice.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
