I have spent the whole afternoon tidying up glass from my patio, from in between the paving slabs and from the grass."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/NINTCHDBPICT000659387528.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/NINTCHDBPICT000659387542.jpg><p>The mum continued: "I found glass several meters away from where the table actually was!! I have two young children who love to run around bare footed (find me a child who doesn’t!).</p><p>"We have literally vacuumed the paving slabs as well as swept them to try and ensure all traces of glass are gone. This was a set purchased from <a href=#>Argos</a> who have said they cannot do anything about it as it was purchased over a year ago and have referred us to the manufacturer.</p><p>"They still sell it. It’s the Cusco 6 seater rattan set. The outcome of this could have been horrific so please just be aware."</p><p>While the mum was unaware of what had caused the apparent "explosion," she added: "It was possibly caused by the heat but outdoor tables should be able to withstand heat!"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/NINTCHDBPICT000659387654.jpg><p>A spokesperson from Argos told Fabulous: "Although it’s extremely rare, glass tables can break for a number of reasons and so our sets are designed to shatter safely into small pieces to prevent serious injury.</p><p>And added: "We have reviewed the images and can see that’s what’s happened in this case."</p><p>Thousands commented on her post, with many revealing the same thing had happened to them with their table.</p><p>One mum shared: "That’s happened to me twice awful mess was finding glass forever."</p><p>"I see this happen every single year soooo many times, doesn't make a difference where its from. Glass outdoor tables shouldn't be sold," another wrote.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">To reduce the risk of damage it is recommended that:</h3></p><ul><li>During assembly do not lay the glass directly onto hard or rough surfaces. We recommend laying the glass on a blanket or cardboard during assembly. You could even use the box.</li><li>When lifting or moving the product, ask for someone to lend a hand, trying to move a product on your own can lead to accidents.</li><li>Do not use furniture if any parts are missing or broken. Contact your retailer immediately.</li><li>Do not place very hot or very cold items, such as saucepans or barbecues, directly on the glass surface. Extreme temperature differences over small areas can damage glass.</li><li>Do not sit or stand upon the glass surface.</li><li>Do not strike the glass with hard or pointed items, or use the glass as a chopping surface.</li><li>Do not drag rough or heavy objects over the top of the glass.</li><li>We recommend using place mats, coasters and table cloths to help protect against scratches and accidentally dropped items.</li><li>Clean the glass regularly to make sure there are no grit on the top.</li><li>Do not clean glass with washing powders or any other substances containing abrasives, since these substances can scratch glass.</li><li>For tables that can be used outdoors, if your table has a parasol, make sure the edge of the parasol cut-out has a protector in place. In addition always use a weighted parasol base, and remove the parasol in windy conditions. Parasols can put pressure on the table top or even blow the table over in windy weather.</li><li>For tables that can be used outdoors it is advised that the table is kept covered when not in use to protect the glass from the weather and accidental damage.</li><li>If you have any concerns regarding your product please contact your retailer immediately.</li></ul><p>A third commented: "It happened to mine and a friends too. Keep the frame and buy a wood or equivalent board cut to size and staple gun a pvc table cloth to it."</p><p>Trying to offer an explanation, one person offered: "This can happen to anything that has tempered glass. They take knocks here and there and this can eventually cause them to unexpectedly explode."</p><p>Another said: "It’s to do with the heat and not a manufacturing issue sadly glass at such heat as we have had will literally Buckle under this pressure, last year this happened to our shower screen in our bathroom it was so hot it just shattered."</p><p>Previously, the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Furniture Industry Research Association</a> released an explanation for why glass furniture might shatter, and advised people on what they can do you reduce the risk.</p><p>It reads: "Toughened glass is designed to shatter into lots of small granular pieces when damaged. This is a safety feature to reduce the risk of injury, as it doesn’t form large and jagged shards like normal (annealed) glass.</p><p>"In rare instances, if toughened glass is damaged, it can lead to the glass breaking seemingly of its own accord.</p><p>"Damage to the glass (not always visible) can get worse over time until it reaches a critical point when it may shatter. This is not a fault with the product or design, this is how the toughened glass is intended to behave if damaged."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Fabulous</h2></p><p>Meanwhile, check out this <a href=#>mum who transformed her old garden furniture for just £17 to create a stunning boho escape.</a></p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Plus, thrifty couple quoted&nbsp;<a href=#>£10k to overhaul garden create stunning outdoor space using B&M bargains - and there's even an egg chair.</a></p><p>And&nbsp;<a href=#>give your garden a glow up with these top 10 stylish items</a>, including a stone-baked pizza oven and projector for your very own outdoor cinema.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Woman claims she broke out in hives and was rushed to hospital after setting up new Wayfair garden furniture</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5BuaXBxaWt%2BcLnUpmSwmaKjtq%2BzjKCjmqujYsGirsueZJ6woKG8pbHSaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmum-warning-glass-table-explodes.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmum-warning-glass-table-explodes.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmum-warning-glass-table-explodes.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmum-warning-glass-table-explodes.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmum-warning-glass-table-explodes.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmum-warning-glass-table-explodes.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./enes-kanter-wife.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./enes-kanter-wife.html>Who Is Enes Kanter Wife?
