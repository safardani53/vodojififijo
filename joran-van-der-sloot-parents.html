Paul was a lawyer who specialized in government law and van der Sloot's mother, Anita, was a quiet art teacher. Along with his two brothers, van der Sloot grew up in Aruba.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Kees van der Spek, a Dutch investigative news reporter, told truTV that van der Sloot became violent in his teens and was often aggressive toward his brothers. Paul wasn't a very hands-on parent and would often give van der Sloot money to gamble with at the local casino. "What I do know is that Joran was the boss of his father and mother," said van der Spek to truTV (per Crime Library). "He would tell them what to do and not the other way around."</p><p>Paul got a job as an attorney with the Aruban government in the hopes of eventually becoming a judge there, which would later contribute to his involvement in the investigation of Holloway's disappearance. The night Holloway's family arrived in Aruba to search for her, they ended up at the van der Sloot home.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>They were accompanied by two Aruban police who spoke with Paul, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vanity Fair</a>. Initially Paul led them to the casino where van der Sloot was spending the evening gambling, but by the time they arrived he had already returned home. Police spoke with van der Sloot there, where Paul was protective of his son.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The van der Sloots were proud of their son.</h2><p>As the investigation continued into the summer, Holloway's mother and stepfather moved into the Holiday Inn where she was staying when she vanished. One day, Holloway's mother was handing out prayer cards when she noticed she was near the van der Sloot residence. Paul and Anita happened to be outside, and promptly invited Holloway's mother in for a conversation that lasted 90 minutes.</p><p>Initially, the van der Sloots "lavished praise" upon their son but soon switched gears and opened up about how difficult he was. Anita confided in Holloway's mother, revealing that van der Sloot was seeing a psychiatrist. "She was saying they were beginning to have trouble with Joran [for a] defiant attitude. The father acknowledged they could not control him. He would sneak out, go gambling, in the pre-dawn hours. They had no control over him," she told Vanity Fair.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>When Holloway's mother suggested that all of Aruba could be released from this nightmare if only the van der Sloots would come forward with what they know, Paul began sweating profusely. It was so bad, claimed Holloway's mother, that Anita had to get a towel in order to wipe up the puddles of sweat.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CBS News</a> reported that in June 2005, Paul was arrested and was a considered a suspect in the disappearance of Holloway. He was released three days later. Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">UPI</a>, Paul collapsed and died in February 2010 while playing tennis; it was later reported as a heart attack. Aruba-based Anita was spotted with an unknown man in May 2023 at a local arts center and at her house, reported <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fox News</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn7yzrc1mrZqmXZmys3nSpaaorF2lrrOxza2q</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjoran-van-der-sloot-parents.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjoran-van-der-sloot-parents.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjoran-van-der-sloot-parents.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjoran-van-der-sloot-parents.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjoran-van-der-sloot-parents.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjoran-van-der-sloot-parents.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./next-leeds-manager-latest-odds.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./next-leeds-manager-latest-odds.html>Leeds next manager odds: Daniel Farke favourite after colossal price change overnight, Patrick Vieir</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./inside-twisted-new-game-show-lucky-13.html>Inside twisted new game show Lucky 13 from creators of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./inside-twisted-new-game-show-lucky-13.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
