Whether you’re running errands or lounging inside, you can wear this clog-style shoe as a house slipper or take it outdoors thanks to its Treadlite technology — a sole design unique to Ugg that is cushioned enough to wear indoors yet durable enough for outdoor use. It’s easy to fall in love with this best-selling slipper because of its ultra-soft sheepskin fur lining — an Ugg signature that keeps your feet toasty warm even during the dead of winter (just ask <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Cardi B</a>). This shoe's material is similar to the soft suede of the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Classic Boot</a>, so it can take on the elements of the outdoors without compromising the comfort that slippers bring to the table.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">What separates these slippers from the crowd is the unique clog-style design: The slip-on style has a slight back, so your foot won’t slip out as you walk. It’s detailed with an embroidered braid design that encircles the collar of the shoe and comes in two neutral shades that fit any season — classic black and the brand’s trademark chestnut hue. Ugg hit a home run with this shoe that delicately toes the line between indoor and outdoor wear, making this style their highest seller in 2023.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Real sheepskin, suede upper, upcycled wool, Tencel lyocell lining, recycled polyester and rayon blend | <strong>Shades:</strong> 2 | <strong>Features: </strong>Treadlite by Ugg EVA outsole, heat-embossed logo</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-celeb-loved-ugg-classic-ultra-mini-platform-boot></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Celeb-Loved</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>UGG Classic Ultra Mini Platform Boot</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Ugg Classic Ultra Mini Platform Boots" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/2feMPguHR8wNUqenDNGnNL1nTZs=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ugg-classic-ultra-mini-platform-boots-540cebd2b5594d83bb6e7bac623d31f8.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ugg</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">After being spotted on Bella Hadid in the stoop-perched pizza picture seen around the world <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>and her sister Gigi</a> on multiple occasions, these ultra-low top, super-platformed boots became one of the most sought-after shoes. This pair sits at much different proportions than the classic boot, its shaft going lower as its platform sole grows taller. You can gain an extra two inches in height thanks to its stacked EVA outsole, which keeps the suede upper a little farther from the ground. (We like to think this gives the material a little more protection. Is this true? We’ll let you know.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The outsole is complete with the brand’s Treadlite technology, a lug sole design that ensures a bit more traction than your typical slipper. Despite this being one of the top sellers this year, the shoe is available in seven different hues — ranging from sandy shades to cherry red (a perfect pick for the holidays).&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Suede upper, upcycled wool, Tencel lyocell lining, polyester binding | <strong>Shades:</strong> 7 | <strong>Features:</strong> Treadlite by Ugg EVA outsole, EVA midsole, leather heel, rear pull tab, asymmetrical topline, embossed logo</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-ugg-ultra-mini-classic-boot></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>UGG Ultra Mini Classic Boot</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="UGG Ultra Mini Classic Boot" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/UOjO9jMp44jIcHAYNJZmBBXRS7Y=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/UGG-Ultra-Mini-Classic-Boot-cc4cf3f0fd194cd6afb0bbd10210d66d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This year was all about the mini boots — platform or no platform. And for the shoppers who prefer their normal height, the Classic Ultra Mini Boots are still a hit. While this boot features the same 3-inch shaft that the Ultra Mini Platform Boots do, the sole has a classic height (versus its 2-inch-platformed sister). Nothing separates this style from the others besides its shortened shaft and regular sole, but what is unique to this one is the array of shades that are only available for this particular mini boot: moss green, slate gray, lilac, and more.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Twinface sheepskin upper, sheepskin lining, upcycled wool, Tencel lyocell sockliner, polyester binding | <strong>Shades:</strong> 7 | <strong>Features:</strong> Water repellency treatment, Treadlite by Ugg EVA outsole, leather heel, embossed logo</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-ugg-classic-dipper></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Ugg Classic Dipper</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Ugg Classic Dipper" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/bZMMP48x1jXwjmlOa-3CuJy1v04=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ugg-classic-dipper-ddd831fb8bd3404cb7fb7ce115cf26b8.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ugg</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Ugg boots have become fixtures in celebrity streetwear this past year, including this brand new style after a cameo on model <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Emily Ratajkowski</a> as she roamed the streets of New York City. The Dipper is an elevated take on the Classic Boot, complete with a sock-like neoprene shaft, suede upper, 2-inch platform, and ankle zipper for easy on-and-off. Its stretchy shaft makes this boot feel a little more equipped to handle the elements of the outdoors than the typical all-suede shoe (though this one does still feature the staple suede upper). Its two neutral colors, black and chestnut, make this maximalist shoe a bit more wearable with everyday outfits, while its plush wool lining keeps the footbed soft for comfortable, all-day wear. Pair the Dippers with a midi skirt like Ratajkowski or slip them on with your favorite sweat set for errands around town.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Neoprene, suede, upcycled wool, Tencel lyocell lining and sockliner | <strong>Shades:</strong> 2 | <strong>Features:</strong> Sugarcane EVA outsole, EVA midsole, medial zipper, shaft zippers, pull tab, heat-embossed, logo</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-ugg-womens-scuffette-ii-house-slippers></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>UGG Scuffette II Slippers</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="UGG Scuffette II House Slipper" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/j85ZmfHTHYj7KCaIvz54PS_xZes=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ugg-scuffette-ii-house-slipper-e7af39056d7541ecbf1942a34c5dfe32.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>UGG</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Scuffette II is the "women’s" version of the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Scuff slipper</a> (though anyone can wear these cozy slides). This shoe is a best-seller thanks to its ultra-soft sheepskin interior, which curls up to create the thick collar of the shoe. What separates these slides from the others, however, is the soft outsole that is designed for indoor wear — making these strictly house shoes. Its sole is a cloud of plush fur, a commonality across (almost) all of Ugg’s slippers, ensuring comfort with each step and quality that will last for years. Plus, it’s available in seven subdued shades, so you can find the perfect everyday hue to match your lounge clothes.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Suede upper, sheepskin insole/collar, recycled polyester binding | <strong>Shades:</strong> 7 | <strong>Features:</strong> Sugarcane EVA outsole, EVA midsole, 1-inch platform, fur collar, heat-embossed logo</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-ugg-disquette-slipper></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>UGG Disquette Slipper</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="UGG Disquette" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/NLp5eJdk2WxVBxz0ielHzYYmBZc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ugg-disquette-79666b0065cd4ce7b35abcdcdc4a9cd5.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>UGG</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With the popularity of the platform mini boot, it’s no surprise that people are also loving the one-inch sole featured on the furry Disquette slipper. This mule is an elevated mashup of Ugg's <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Coquette</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Disco</a> styles, just with the addition of a chunky EVA outsole. Its inner contents are similar to the other slippers, featuring a cushy sheepskin footbed, while being finished with the brand’s classic suede upper. The EVA soles make these shoes ultra-thick and durable, meaning you can wear these slippers from your couch to Saturday brunch, so all of this trendiness doesn’t stay cooped up in the house. You can score these slip-ons in black, charcoal, and chestnut colors — a nice spread of neutrals to make them even more wearable than before.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Suede upper, sheepskin collar, recycled polyester binding | <strong>Shades:</strong> 3 | <strong>Features: </strong>Sugarcane EVA outsole, 1-inch platform, woven label, heat-embossed logo</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-ugg-tazz-mule></span> <img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="UGG Tazz Mule" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/Uc9dZ_ZLkj-W8rXsiz7zWDR566c=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ugg-tazz-mule-d1d17652490544d79491b38f73381cad.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>UGG</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Another comfy style that we’ve spotted on celebs is the Tazz clog, an amped-up version of the ever-popular Tasman slipper. Modeled by the likes of Gigi Hadid, this elevated style includes everything we know and love about the low-soled Tasman, even down to the braided embroidery decorating the shoe collar. The two-inch platform comes in four neutral shades with contrasting details — Hadid’s pair, chestnut with red thread, black with white, navy with gray, and sand with mint green. Keeping its fur lining on the inside rather than the Disquette-esque collar, this shoe is perfect for the street — though its furry footbed still feels like the dream house slipper.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Suede upper, recycled polyester, rayon, upcycled wool, Tencel lyocell lining | <strong>Shades:</strong> 4 | <strong>Features:</strong> Sugarcane EVA outsole, EVA midsole, 1.75-inch platform, heat-embossed logo</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-ugg-tazzlita></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Ugg Tazzlita</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Ugg Tazzlita" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/e82QdSZ5_SD-JTaruZFSbDh4Fdw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ugg--tazzlita-81d16dbafe534e3e9be08863274ee9e2.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ugg&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you favor an ultra-plush shoe over anything else (who can blame you?), then the Tazzlita may be the Ugg shoe of your dreams. Complete with a quilted suede upper and a sheepskin fur-clad collar, this clog screams winter like none other. While you may have to treat some of your older Ugg shoes with a protectant spray, this pair arrives at your doorstep ready to go, thanks to its water-repellency treatment, which means you can strut on the sidewalks in comfort without worrying about splashes or spillage.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Suede upper, sheepskin collar, upcycled wool, recycled polyester lining, lyocell sockliner | <strong>Shades:</strong> 2 | <strong>Features:</strong> SugarSole EVA outsole, suede-wrapped midsole, 1.75-inch platform, post-applied protection treatment, heat-embossed logo</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-ugg-classic-mini-ii></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Ugg Classic Mini II</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Ugg Classic Mini II" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/2eIevVJ4lXl0ze0PMKxJTnRhr9A=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ugg-classic-mini-ii-13ed954ee229400585df8df57bfc6071.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Keeping in line with the trend of all things mini this year, it’s no surprise that the Classic Mini II was a hit this past year. This shaft-shortened version of the original Classic Boot keeps the staples that we know and love about Ugg boots at the forefront of its design — no frills, just quality sheepskin material, a warm, woolen interior, and a timeless silhouette. The shaft hits at the halfway point between the regular “short” boot (8 inches) and mini (3.5 inches), rounding out at 5 inches tall. The go-to color tends to be chestnut, but in case you feel like freshening up your footwear, there are nine other neutrals to choose from before you add this pair to your cart.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Sheepskin upper/lining/insole, recycled polyester binding, leather | <strong>Shades:</strong> 9 | <strong>Features:</strong> Sugarcane EVA outsole, pull tab, post-applied protection treatment, embossed logo</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-ugg-classic-heritage-bow></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Ugg Classic Heritage Bow</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Ugg Classic Heritage Bow" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/CtflNlg13Z5ByxLEzVJt3aoOiAI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ugg--classic-heritage-bow-2c4aee50d5704eb48c03029fdb777b92.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ugg&nbsp;</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While some would argue that bows never went out of style, no one can deny the resurgence of all things feminine with the rise of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>balletcore</a> and Barbie-inspired trends. Ugg has long designed bow-adorned boots (remember the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Bailey Bow</a>?), but the Classic Heritage Bow was easily the frilliest style to take over the best-seller list this year. The boot’s inner fur spills out of the collar in a plush cloud and is pulled together with a literal (and equally fuzzy) suede bow. You can pick up this cutesy style in the classic chestnut shade with contrasting ivory wool or opt for the all-black boot for an edgier moment. No matter how you style it, this sweet slipper is sure to elevate your look whether you’re hanging out indoors or flashing your new shoes on the street.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Twinface sheepskin upper, suede heel, wool, recycled polyester binding, lyocell sockliner | <strong>Shades:</strong> 2 | <strong>Features:</strong> Treadlite by Ugg outsole, foam footbed, woven heel label with logo</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-ugg-coquette-slipper></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>UGG Coquette Slipper</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="UGG Women's Coquette Slipper" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/t6aq8tDiqRKIPz4bg-Y7c-2qS-k=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ugg-womens-coquette-slipper-aa760c9024d54726b781456028d9d1c6.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>UGG&nbsp;</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This slipper silhouette is as traditional as it gets, but Ugg elevates the timeless style with a super thick fur trim that lines the interior and edge of the shoe. While you may look at these slippers and deem them appropriate for indoor use only, you actually can take this ultra-fluffy pair outside, thanks to the Treadlite outsole. This protects the delicate suede exterior from the elements in the cooler months and gives you the duality of wearing this slip-on for lounging or all-day errand running. Just be sure to wear a thick sock with this pair of Uggs if you plan to wear them out in the cold, as the mule design will expose your heels to the brisk air.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Sheepskin upper/insole, recycled polyester binding, suede | <strong>Shades:</strong> 3 | <strong>Features:</strong> Sugarcane EVA outsole, label with embossed logo</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-pick-the-right-ugg-slippers></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Pick the Right Ugg Slippers&nbsp;</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Environment</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Where do you plan to wear your Ugg slippers? Your answer will be instrumental in picking out the best pair for you. As we saw on this list of best-sellers, most of Uggs’ slippers can be worn both indoors and outdoors, like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Tasman slippers</a> — whereas some furrier styles, like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Disquette</a>, are a bit riskier to wear out on the street (but are still outdoor-friendly). When you’re shopping, make sure to grab a pair with a sturdy sole if you plan to wear them outdoors. However, if you’d rather your shoes serve as house shoes, any of these pairs are perfectly equipped to take on that role, as well.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Style</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With the many different styles of slippers that Ugg provides, it’s important to know which look you lean toward — this will make the process of choosing the right pair a bit simpler. A popular choice is anything that comes with a platform, making the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Tazz</a> a great option for trendy dressers.

Many of Ugg's slippers include sheepskin while others use a blend of upcycled wool or 100 percent recycled polyester blends. If you’re someone who craves the softest fur that Ugg can provide, then you may be drawn to the sheepskin lining that many of these best-sellers contain. On the other hand, if you want to stray away from pure animal fur, go for Ugg’s slippers that are made of upcycled wool and polyester (still containing small percentages of animal fur, just not in its purest form).<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-faq-80f6f315-db49-4ba8-8bc6-2959c27981e3></span><p>Frequently Asked Questions</p><ul id=mntl-sc-block-faq__content_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-faq__content mntl-accordion" readability=49.381686310063><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>Can you wear Ugg shoes outside?</span></p><p>There are some Ugg slippers that you can wear outside and some that are advised for indoor-use only. You can usually tell by looking at each design whether it can be worn outdoors because these slippers will have thicker soles. Be sure to read the product descriptions of your slipper of choice to make sure that you’re not walking outside in a pair that should be worn inside only.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-0.96625766871166><p><span class=accordion__title>How do you clean Ugg shoes?</span></p><p>According to the Ugg website, the brand’s slippers should be hand-washed with cold water and a small amount of the sheepskin <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Cleaner and Conditioner</a>. After you’ve gently scrubbed the sheepskin surface with a wet sponge, rinse the two solutions out with cold water and pack the inside of the slippers with paper to maintain their shape. Leave them out to dry (out of direct sunlight) and brush the suede in the same direction once the fabric has dried.</p><p>If your white-fur slippers are starting to turn a slightly different color, then it’s time to give them a nice wash — and that fur, whether it’s faux or real, requires a different set of solutions. The Cleaner and Conditioner that you use on the upper of your shoe can be used for the fur parts as well, but you’ll need to follow it up with the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Shoe Renew</a> — a treatment that deodorizes the fur (important for the woolen footbed of your shoes) and prevents future odors from developing.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-0.89807162534435><p><span class=accordion__title>How can you protect the suede fabric of your Uggs?</span></p><p>After treating your shoes with the Cleaner and Conditioner (and letting them fully dry), <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">the site recommends</a> spraying the fabric with the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Care Ugg Protector</a> to keep them looking and feeling brand new.

This means that a women’s size seven is a men’s size five. Alternatively, to convert your “men’s” shoe size to a U.S. “women’s,” add a size and a half to your original number. So if you’re a “men’s” ten, you would be a “women’s” eleven and a half.</p></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-take-our-word-for-it></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Take Our Word For It</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Alyssa Brascia</a> is a commerce writer for PEOPLE, covering beauty, fashion, home and lifestyle products.
