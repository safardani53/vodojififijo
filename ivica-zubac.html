He is the eldest child of Ivan Zubac and Dijana Zubac. Moreover, he has two younger brothers and a sister in his family.</p><p>Young Ivica grew up in Citluk near the border of Croatia. Even though he has dual citizenship, Zubac identifies as a Croatian. As a child, Zubac attended a private school in the same town.</p><p>He started playing basketball for fun when he was just 5 years old. His father, Ivan, was an amateur basketball player while in his teens. Moreover, Ivica’s cousin, <strong>Zoran Planinic</strong>, used to play in the NBA around the same time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Ivica-Zubac-with-his-younger-brother-Antonio.jpg><p>As a result, both his cousin and his athletic father inspired him to keep playing basketball. Ivan had even prepared a small court for his sons and friends to practice the sport. As a kid, he played basketball with bigger local boys.&nbsp;</p><p>Initially, he felt hard as he could not keep up with the elder boys. They often ignored him, and soon after, he felt like he was not made for playing basketball.</p><p>However, sometime later, he gained height, which gave him confidence.</p><p>Consequently, he returned to the court three years after completely stopped playing basketball. Moreover, he joined the local team and practiced shooting and drills. As a result, he showed rapid progress in a brief period under the team’s new coach, <strong>Ivo Bundic</strong>.</p><p>His younger brother, Antonio, is also tall and plays basketball as a power forward. Likewise, his youngest brother, Mario, plays basketball and dreams of making it to the NBA like his eldest brother.</p><p>In addition, the player has a younger sister named Marijaandjela.</p><p>Ivica never attended college, as he later entirely focused on his basketball career.</p><h2>Ivica Zubac | Career</h2><h3>Professional Career</h3><h4>European Leagues</h4><p>For many years, Ivica Zubac played local games for his hometown club, Brotnjo. However, he soon began to dominate in the local-level games.

He played one more season for the club until they transferred him to the Serbian Basketball League Mega Leks.</p><p><a href=#><strong>&lt;&lt;&lt; Maxi Kleber Bio: NBA & Net Worth >>></strong></a></p><p>After having a brief professional career in Serbia, Ivica went to America to play in the NBA League.&nbsp;</p><h4>NBA Career</h4><p>Zubac entered the NBA draft in 2016 while still affiliated with Mega Leks. The Los Angeles Lakers selected him as the draft’s second-round 32nd pick.</p><p>He officially signed with the Lakers on July 7, 2016. Soon after, the club assigned him to play in the 2016 NBA Summer League. Eventually, he made an NBA debut for the club against the Atlanta Hawks on November 2.</p><p>Zubac played about two and a half seasons for the Lakers in the NBA and tried his best to deliver well.</p><p>However, he got very little playtime, and his performance throughout his years at the club could not fruitful.</p><p>Consequently, the Lakers traded him to the LA Clippers on February 7, 2019. After moving to the new club, he made slight progress and played his first-ever NBA playoff matches. Playing around 26 partners, Zubac averaged 9.4 points per game.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Ivica-Zubac-in-the-Lakers-jersey.jpg><p>Furthermore, he played an essential role in leading the Lakers to two more NBA playoffs in the 2019-20 and 2020-21 seasons.
