He was born on July 28, 1984, just over a year after his parents got married. John took an interest in acting and sports early on and acted in a few of his dad’s films in the early 1990s before playing football when he attended Morehouse College. His skills led him to getting signed with the St. Louis Rams as an undrafted free agent in the NFL in 2006 and was released that same year. He went on to play in NFL Europe for the Rhein Fire in 2007 and was drafted by the California Redwoods of the UFL in 2009. He played with the latter, which was renamed the Sacramento Mountain Lions until 2012.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>In the early 2010s, John <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>returned to acting</a> and played in several other films such as Malcolm & Marie and the television series Baller from 2015 until 2019.

Russell&nbsp;</strong>on his 2022 film&nbsp;Amsterdam.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>John has been very open about following in his dad’s footsteps throughout his career. He admitted that he tries to put his acting ahead of worrying about his father’s thoughts on his performances in a September 2022 press conference speaking about his Broadway debut in&nbsp;The Piano Lesson,&nbsp;per&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>People</a>. “Am I nervous when [my father is] watching me on stage?” he said. “I don’t know if I have time to be nervous about what he thinks.” Although he did reveal the best advice he got from Denzel. “The freedom to fail, to find out, flourish in that failure. In that being uncomfortable, you’ll find the greatest parts of yourself as an artist,” he explained.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Despite speaking about the inspiration he found from his dad, John did open up about his father’s prominence in the film industry made him initially want to play football rather than act in an August 2021 interview with <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>iNews</a>. “Because of his position in the business, I became an introvert. I rebelled as a teenager, but I put that resentment into physical activity, which was football. It requires a helmet, so nobody sees your face. They see the name Washington, but they don’t know who you are. They don’t care,” he told the outlet.</p><h2>Katia</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/denzel-washington-kids-malcolm-katia-SS-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-9>Katia is Denzel and Pauletta’s second-born child.
