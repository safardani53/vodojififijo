The Sun Online they are engaging with the respective residents to resolve their concerns quickly and effectively.</p><p>And they are enlisting the expertise of an independent structural engineer to assess the issues raised and determine potential remedial action as soon as possible.</p><p>A spokesperson for the company added:&nbsp;“We apologise to residents for any disturbance they may have experienced as a result of our initial site excavation works.</p><p>"We regularly monitor the works being carried out at the Raveloe Gardens development to ensure any potential disruption is kept to a minimum.</p><p>“We conducted vibration tests on site as soon as residents made us aware of their concerns.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE
