Because of Roblox, a game hosting platform, many individual games like Royale High have had to temporarily stop offering services. Other games like Dragon Adventures, Adopt Me, Tornado Valley Ultimate, and others may have been affected. Players are being advised to not play or join today, otherwise everything they do could get wiped.&nbsp;</p><p>"GUYS, DO NOT JOIN RH OR ANY GAME ON ROBLOX &nbsp;THE DATA LOSS GLITCH IS [HAPPENING] TO EVERYONE.

So stay away from Roblox for a little while as it may be the difference from your account being banned or not," the Redditor explained.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>PLEASE READ, IT'S IMPORTANT!!</p><p>DONT PLAY ANY ROBLOX GAMES RIGHT NOW, THERE'S DATA LOSS AND A LOT OF GAMES LIKE ADOPT ME HAVE BEEN LOCKED.

This freaked out so many people, that a YouTube video was created to calm people down and explain that the ban wave should only last five minutes, max. It's understandable why people would be alarmed. According to Reddit, children were receiving messages from Roblox saying that their accounts were banned due to "inappropriate content," but it was a glitch on Roblox's end.</p><p>However, Roblox doesn't have the best reputation for their data storage. Six months ago, something similar happened, and users united in a panic, wondering if their games were lost forever. "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>What is happening to Roblox?</u></a> I lost my game data in 2 games," one Reddit post announced. Someone wrote that the game Jailbroke "broke" Roblox, while someonee else wrote, "I would try join these games again and see if it loads now. Roblox was having issues with their datastore and marketplace services earlier."</p><p>This also happened a year ago, and<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> <u>Roblox actually posted a message</u></a> on their dev forum explaining the issue. It's unclear if this is the same problem.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Roblox</span></figure><p>For now, especially if you're a Royale High player, it's important to sit tight, not start a new game, and wait for either other users to tell you that it's all clear, or for Roblox themselves to release a statement or post on their developers' forum.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfp7yjuM6xZJ2ZpJZ6rbvSrA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2froblox-data-loss.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2froblox-data-loss.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2froblox-data-loss.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2froblox-data-loss.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2froblox-data-loss.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2froblox-data-loss.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./who-bobby-boyd-divorce.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./who-bobby-boyd-divorce.html>Who is Bobby Boyd? | The US Sun</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./dancing-on-ice-michelle-heaton-birthday-party.html>Inside Dancing On Ice's Michelle Heaton's 11th birthday party for daughter with Chanel-inspired cake</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./dancing-on-ice-michelle-heaton-birthday-party.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
