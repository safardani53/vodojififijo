And now that I’ve really found myself, I’m just accepting of everything that I feel inside and don’t shove everything down.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Jenna welcomed her kids in two former relationships. She gave birth to her twin sons on March 16, 2009 when she was with UFC pro, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Tito Ortiz</strong></a>. She had her third kid with her former<span> fiancé,<strong> Lior Bitton</strong>, in 2017.

Read on to learn more about Jessi and her relationship with Jenna below.&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-4>&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/jessi-lawless-5-things-to-know-ss-embed1.jpg><h2>Jessi Lawless Is A Barber</h2><p id=content-paragraph-5>Jessi Lawless is a professional barber and hair educator who previously worked for Oster Professional, according to her official <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>website</a>. She also gives free back-to-school haircuts to those in need each year.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>She has an “unapologetic approach to life advice and has built a reputation for resilience & tenacity”, per her website. “Her brutal honest & quick wit makes her one of the most dynamic creators out there. Her ‘excuses are crutches for fools’ attitude is the driving force behind her success, and she hopes to inspire her audience to overcome adversity through positivity & determination,” the site adds.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Jessi is extremely active on social media and has nearly 2 million followers across <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Twitter</a>, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Facebook</a>, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a>, and <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TikTok</a>. 1.5 million of those followers are on TikTok alone. She also runs an <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>OnyFans</a> account, where she charges $17 per month for subscriptions.</p><h2>Jessi Lawless Is An Entrepreneur</h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>Aside from building an incredible reputation for hairstyling, Jessi has a podcast called <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Born Lawless</a>, which she launched in May 2023. In typical Jessi style, her podcast touts her willingness to say what people are thinking, “but are too afraid to say.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>In addition, she is the co-owner of <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Savage Sip Coffee Co</a>., which she frequently<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> posts about</a> online and promotes on her website. Furthermore, she has her own <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>merch line</a> of t-shirts, coffee mugs, phone cases, and more.</p><h2>How Did Jessi And Jenna Meet?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-14>Jessi told fans about her and Jenna’s love story in a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>video</a> she shared online and revealed they met over Instagram. “Apparently, she had been following <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>me on Instagram</a> for about a year, and when she became single, she also became more engaging on my posts,” Jessi recalled. She explained that she didn’t know it was Jenna Jameson because her Instagram handle isn’t her full name. She also said she had a girlfriend at the time, so she didn’t pay much attention to Jenna’s comments. However, one day, curiosity got the best of her and she looked at her admirer’s Instagram page to find out who she was.</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>Once Jessi became single, she replied to one of Jenna’a comments — but was mortified when she discovered she had not just replied to the comment, but directly messaged her as well. Oops! Things worked out, though, and they began messaging and then texting. Jessi said she was beginning to “catch feelings” after a few months of flirty conversation, but thought Jenna was out of her league. So, when she met another girl at “an event,” she decided to pursue her.</p><p id=content-paragraph-16>“When I did, [Jenna] told me I was a moron and she was absolutely right,” Jessi admitted. “And then she said, ‘Don’t come crawling back when it all falls apart.’ And that’s exactly what I did when it all fell apart.” Luckily, Jenna gave her a chance and they have been together ever since.</p><h2>Jessi Has No Problem Calling People Out</h2><p id=content-paragraph-17>As her website says, Jessi has no problem calling things how she sees them. That was especially true with an April 18<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Instagram video</a> she dedicated to “all the butt-hurt dudes” in Jenna’s comment section. After calling the men out, she flaunted their relationship with vivid descriptions of their home life. “You stare at her in a magazine. I stare at her with her head between my legs. We’re not the same,” she said. “You wake up with her on your mind. I wake up with her on my face. We’re not the same.” She continued on, but the point has been made.</p><h2>Jessi’s Dad Walked Jenna Down The Aisle</h2><p id=content-paragraph-18>Jessi and Jenna<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> got married</a> at the Little Church of the West in Nevada, which is where Jenna’s parents also made their union official. Sadly, Jenna’a father is no longer living, so Jessi’a father did the honor of walking Jenna down the aisle to Jessi. <span>“I was standing up there waiting for her, and I looked at the back of the church and I saw her standing there and I looked at my dad and I said, ‘Dad.’ And he looked over at me and I said, ‘Go walk Jenna down the aisle right now,'” she told PEOPLE.&nbsp; </span>The pair had a “very Las Vegas wedding”, according to Jessi, but they plan to have a bigger and more formal ceremony down the road.</p><p id=content-paragraph-19>Jessi is the one who popped the question, which she also recalled during her interview with PEOPLE. “We were laying in bed and we were just talking, and I had the ring, I’d had the ring for a minute,” she noted. “I reached over in my bedside table and I pulled it out and I walked around to her side of the bed and I got down on one knee and I told her that she was the most incredible woman that I’d ever encountered and I could think of nothing better than for her to be my wife.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2K3pr%2FSomSlmaehsrS%2FjKOcp6aRYreiucSspqdlp56zpnmUamhtbmRrfA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-jessi-lawless-jenna-jameson-wife-5114646.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-is-jessi-lawless-jenna-jameson-wife-5114646.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-jessi-lawless-jenna-jameson-wife-5114646.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-is-jessi-lawless-jenna-jameson-wife-5114646.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-jessi-lawless-jenna-jameson-wife-5114646.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-jessi-lawless-jenna-jameson-wife-5114646.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./ben-martin-3.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./ben-martin-3.html>Ben Martin (golfer)</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./rewind-festival-2018-tickets-line-up.html>When is Rewind Festival 2018, what is the line-up and how can I buy tickets?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./rewind-festival-2018-tickets-line-up.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
