Haley and Hope, who were clad in bike gear and sitting atop their bikes.</p><p>The girls wore red tie-dye shirts with American flag heart designs.</p><p>They also had red, white, and blue pom-poms on their bikes.</p><p>Hoda wore her hair up and was seen smiling off to the side, proud of her daughters.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE ON HODA KOTB">READ MORE ON HODA KOTB</h2><p>She chose to wear a navy striped shirt, which she paired with red, white, and blue beads.</p><p>In another snap, Hoda was seen snuggling close to her daughters.</p><p>She grinned widely at the camera, wearing a headband with "YAY" and "USA" lettering on top.</p><p>The girls clung to their mom, clearly smitten.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><h2>PINK LADY</h2><p>Meanwhile, Hoda showed off her trim figure in a hot pink outfit ahead of Kim Petras's live concert.</p><p>Pop star&nbsp;<a href=#>Kim Petras</a>&nbsp;joined the&nbsp;<a href=#>Today</a>&nbsp;hosts to discuss her upcoming debut album.</p><p>She also celebrated Pride weekend in New York City.</p><p><a href=#>Hoda Kotb</a>&nbsp;and the rest of&nbsp;<a href=#>Today</a>'s on-camera&nbsp;crew chatted with her about her career.</p><p>The official Today show Twitter account shared a clip from the event.</p><p>The tweet was captioned: "@kimpetras is talking all about her debut album, how she’s celebrating Pride weekend in NYC, and learning English from Britney Spears."</p><p>Hoda sported a pink, tight-fitting jumpsuit.</p><p>She wore her hair down in her signature brown curls.</p><p>She also wore minimal makeup and jewelry.</p><p>The jumpsuit was so long that it trailed the ground.</p><h2>NOT TODAY!</h2><p>Hoda scolded her co-host, Jenna Bush Hager, for inadvertently cursing on-air.</p><p><a href=#>Jenna</a>&nbsp;slipped up and said an NSFW word live on-air on Wednesday's episode of&nbsp;<a href=#>Today</a>&nbsp;with Hoda & Jenna, and&nbsp;<a href=#>Hoda</a>&nbsp;quickly reprimanded her for it.</p><p>The mistake occurred during the morning show's game segment, What's the Name of This Game Again?</p><p>Today's associate producer Sean Hickey played the segment's game show host and asked the competing co-hosts questions.</p><p>Initially, the game went smoothly until Sean asked: "What's the name of that movie?"</p><p>The clues given were: "<a href=#>Queen Latifah</a>, she's like an ex-con?, moves into&nbsp;<a href=#>Steve Martin's</a>&nbsp;house, and falls in love with dad from&nbsp;<a href=#>'Schitt's Creek</a>.'"</p><p>Each clue described the plot of the movie Bringing Down The House.</p><p>Hoda, 58, sat quietly as she pondered what the correct answer was.</p><p>However, Jenna, 41, was so shocked at some of the movie's storyline that she yelled, "she falls in love with the dad from Schitt's Creek!"</p><p>Actor&nbsp;<a href=#>Eugene Levey</a>, 76, portrayed the dad in the sitcom series Schitt's Creek.</p><h2>DON'T SAY THAT!</h2><p>She repeated it again for a dramatic effect, stirring Hoda and Sean when she did.</p><p>"Stop saying that you only get one time," Hoda chastised.</p><p>Sean also responded, reiterating that they only could say Schitt's Creek once.</p><p>The Schitt's word in Schitt's Creek sounds very similar to the curse word s**t.</p><p>And the way Jenna pronounced it sounded like she was saying s**t's, hence Sean and Hoda's reaction.</p><p>Neither Hoda nor Jenna knew the answer was Bringing Down The House, so neither of them got a point.</p><p>That point wouldn't have made a difference in the long run since Jenna won by landslide, finishing at six points, while Hoda ended with two.</p><p>Jenna's prize was a framed photograph of Sean hosting the, What's the Name of This Game Again? segment on a past episode.</p><p>Though Hoda and Sean saved Jenna from an on-air blunder, they haven't always been successful in their rescue.</p><h2>HAIR WE GO AGAIN</h2><p>In April, Jenna stole the spotlight on the morning show episode.</p><p>She&nbsp;acknowledged on-air that her&nbsp;<a href=#>hair wasn't cooperating</a>&nbsp;with her after she attempted to adjust it multiple times during the show.</p><p>On April 6, the Today&nbsp;<a href=#>Twitter</a>&nbsp;account shared a clip from the morning show of Jenna, 41, and her co-host&nbsp;<a href=#>Hoda Kotb's</a>, 58, segment Today Food.</p><p>During the segment, the&nbsp;<a href=#>TV</a>&nbsp;personalities interviewed&nbsp;<a href=#>Food Network</a>&nbsp;star Chef Alex Guarnaschelli as she prepared her mom's linguine with clams recipe for the hosts.</p><p>Midway through the segment, she handed a plate to the news reporters so they could try what she cooked.</p><p>While Jenna was eating, her bouncy tresses kept falling into her face.</p><p>She ran her fingers through her hair subtly, repositioning her golden brown hair strands away from her mouth.</p><p>When Jenna tried to keep eating, her hair repeatedly kept coming toward her mouth.</p><p>Near the end of the segment, her hair looked slightly disheveled, proving her finger combing to be futile.</p><p>Jenna realized her defeat, explaining that her hair was still "all over the place" before she rushed to break.</p><p>This wasn't the first time something awkward happened to Jenna on the show.</p><p>Jenna suffered a&nbsp;<a href=#>wardrobe malfunction</a>&nbsp;during Today With Hoda and Jenna in December 2022.</p><p>Upon realizing it, she slammed her co-host Hoda not telling her about the issue sooner.</p><p>During the episode, the latter namesake host ran into a bit of trouble with her appearance a few minutes into the show.</p><p>The hosts got to talking about the “most stressful TV scenes of 2022,” before Jenna started to deal with some of her own stress.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>As&nbsp;Jenna&nbsp;sat open-mouthed, trying to figure out where to take the show next, Hoda looked over at her and realized there was something wrong with her makeup – though&nbsp;Hoda&nbsp;apparently had realized it earlier, too.</p><p>“Go like this,” Hoda told Jenna, while pretending to wipe something off her own front teeth.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto
