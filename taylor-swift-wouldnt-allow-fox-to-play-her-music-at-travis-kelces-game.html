The singer could be seen cheering, even doing a chest bump with her pal after Travis scored a touchdown during the game. (The Chiefs ultimately defeated the Bears 41-10.)&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted0>While <a href=#>unable to use her discography to hype the event</a> up even more, Zyons explained how Fox Sports still managed to showcase Swift’s appearance at Arrowhead in their live coverage.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“The first time we peeked in on Kelce’s suite was during player introductions, minutes before the start of the broadcast,” he wrote in his blog. “Swift was there, seated next to Kelce’s mother Donna, <a href=#>and they both erupted in cheers as the tight end ran out</a> of the tunnel. We played that back on tape early in the telecast.”</span></p><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Zyons noted that coverage then became “a matter of balance” between highlighting the game and Swift’s reactions. “Russo showed restraint not taking gratuitous live shots, saving the opportunities for when she reacted to action in the game,” he continued. “Her joyful expression <a href=#>after Kelce scored a touchdown</a> was the image of the day, captured beautifully by our low-end-zone cameraman <strong>Andy Mitchell</strong>.”</span></p><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted0>After the Chiefs secured their win, Swift was spotted leaving the stadium with Travis in a purple convertible before heading over to a private afterparty to celebrate with his teammates. In post-game celebration pics obtained by TMZ, Swift could be seen wrapping her arm around the tight end as the twosome conversed with other attendees.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1700208131.jpg><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted0>While everyone from Swifties to the NFL is invested in Swift and Travis’ relationship, the duo have only met up a couple of times, a source exclusively told Us Weekly earlier this week.</span></p><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“Taylor and Travis met shortly after he tried giving her his phone number at her show earlier this summer,” the insider said. “They’ve only hung out twice.”</span></p><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Over the summer, Kelce <a href=#>attended Swift’s Eras Tour in Kansas City</a> at Arrowhead Stadium and wanted to give her a DIY friendship bracelet that included his phone number. However, <a href=#>he shared his disappointment</a> that he didn’t have the chance to talk the pop star before or after the concert. Kelce then invited the singer to come watch him take the field earlier this month — and she attended a game three days later.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“Shout-out to Taylor for pulling up. <a href=#>That was pretty ballsy</a>,” Travis said on the Wednesday, September 27, episode of his “<a href=# rel=noopener>New Heights</a>” podcast, adding that it was “hilarious” to see the reaction from players and fans alike.&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“I just thought it was awesome that everybody in the suite had nothing but great things to say about her. The friends and family. She looked amazing … and on top of that, the day went perfect for Chiefs fans. We script it all, ladies and gentleman,” he teased. “It was absolutely electric.”</span></p><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted0>He continued: “To see the slow motion chest bumps, to see the high fives with mom, to see how Chiefs kingdom was all excited that she was there … it was definitely a game I’ll remember, that’s for damn sure.”</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKuasZykv26%2F1qKdrWWnpMKtsM2tZJqknKTEbrLOsWStp12luaLFjKGcq2WdqsCqr4yaq2asopbDqr%2BMpJylm5WoeqitzJ5m</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftaylor-swift-wouldnt-allow-fox-to-play-her-music-at-travis-kelces-game.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ftaylor-swift-wouldnt-allow-fox-to-play-her-music-at-travis-kelces-game.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ftaylor-swift-wouldnt-allow-fox-to-play-her-music-at-travis-kelces-game.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ftaylor-swift-wouldnt-allow-fox-to-play-her-music-at-travis-kelces-game.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftaylor-swift-wouldnt-allow-fox-to-play-her-music-at-travis-kelces-game.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftaylor-swift-wouldnt-allow-fox-to-play-her-music-at-travis-kelces-game.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./who-is-jinx-dating.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./who-is-jinx-dating.html>Who is Jinx Dating Now</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./james-franco-is-writing-a-book-about-lana-del-rey-because-of-cou.html>James Franco is Writing a Book About Lana Del Rey Because of Course He Is</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./james-franco-is-writing-a-book-about-lana-del-rey-because-of-cou.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
