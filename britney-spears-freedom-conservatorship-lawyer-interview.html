Judge </span>Penny<span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;previously denied Britney’s request to remove Jamie from the role, which he has held for 13 years, according to court documents obtained by&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>HollywoodLife&nbsp;</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>on Thursday, Aug. 12.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Britney-Spears-Free-From-Conservatorship-2-Weeks-SS-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7><span data-preserver-spaces=true>After the bombshell revelation,&nbsp;</span>Matthew<span data-preserver-spaces=true>issued a statement to&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>HollywoodLife</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>. “I announced in Court on July 14 that, after 13 years of the status quo, it was time for Mr. Spears to be suspended or removed as conservator and that my firm and I would move aggressively and expeditiously for that outcome,” the lawyer said. “We are pleased that Mr. Spears and his lawyer have today conceded in a filing that he must be removed. It is vindication for Britney.”</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-8><span data-preserver-spaces=true>“According to the California Rules of Court, a conservatorship can end if there is a court order where the court determines that it is no longer required,” Cronin states. “Thus, the next step toward ending the conservatorship will be for Jamie, Britney, and their respective attorneys to return to court for the upcoming hearing to explain their positions and present evidence and testimony.”&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-9><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Until July,&nbsp;</span><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Jamie co-managed the “Toxic” singer’s business affairs</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true>, and&nbsp;</span><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Jodi Montgomery</span></strong></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;was the conservator of her person, meaning Jodi had the ability to dictate who Britney could and couldn’t see, as well as communicate directly with her medical professionals. However, that has since changed. With Jamie officially removed, Jodi is Britney’s legal overseer.&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-10><span data-preserver-spaces=true>“Jodi, as the current conservator, has a fiduciary duty to act in Britney’s best interest. It is Jodi’s responsibility to do what she believes is appropriate to protect Britney,” Cronin shares. “It is possible, based upon the fact that Jodi stepped in to help Britney defend herself against her father’s antics, that Jodi could support Britney and state that she believes Britney is in her right mind and ready to take control of her assets.”</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-11><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Britney has remained largely silent about her 13-year conservatorship, which didn’t get much attention until FX’s 2021 documentary <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Framing Britney Spears</a></span><span data-preserver-spaces=true> premiered on February 5. The film highlighted the conservatorship and gained momentum thanks to the #FreeBritneyMovement.&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-12><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The singer then delivered a harrowing testimony on June 23 that recounted all the ways the legal arrangement had stripped her of her own autonomy. Comparing her father to a “sex trafficker,” Britney </span><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><span data-preserver-spaces=true>called for the removal of Jamie</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;from her conservatorship.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Britney-Spears-Free-From-Conservatorship-2-Weeks-SS-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-13><span data-preserver-spaces=true>During her second hearing in July, the star doubled down on her request to remove Jamie from the arrangement completely — and said she wanted him&nbsp;</span><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><span data-preserver-spaces=true>charged with conservatorship abuse</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true>. “I am petitioning the court because I want my dad out as conservator,” she said. “I want to press charges on my dad today.” Britney later added, “My lawyer didn’t fight for me one time. No, I am not perfect. I am not crazy. My family never cared.”</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-14><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The ”Stronger” singer’s next court date is set for September 29, and ultimately the next steps are to be determined, but since Jamie’s removal, there have been huge strides to ending the conservatorship once and for all. “It appears from Jamie’s statements that he will support Britney and agree with her arguments,” Cronin shared. “The judge will then consider the evidence presented on Britney’s behalf and determine if the conservatorship should end. Since it appears at this time that there is no opposition to ending the conservatorship, it is likely that the judge will rule in Britney’s favor.”</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH16e5BpZpuqmam7psWMrKeemaKoeqe%2BxJ6bqKVdmLyvv8SrrZqsn6fAqbXPZqOar6mav261za2cq66ZmsRw</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbritney-spears-freedom-conservatorship-lawyer-interview.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbritney-spears-freedom-conservatorship-lawyer-interview.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbritney-spears-freedom-conservatorship-lawyer-interview.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbritney-spears-freedom-conservatorship-lawyer-interview.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbritney-spears-freedom-conservatorship-lawyer-interview.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbritney-spears-freedom-conservatorship-lawyer-interview.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./james-franco-is-writing-a-book-about-lana-del-rey-because-of-cou.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./james-franco-is-writing-a-book-about-lana-del-rey-because-of-cou.html>James Franco is Writing a Book About Lana Del Rey Because of Course He Is</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./alana-venums-boyfriend-list.html>Alana Venums Boyfriend: Who is Alana Venum Dating?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./alana-venums-boyfriend-list.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
