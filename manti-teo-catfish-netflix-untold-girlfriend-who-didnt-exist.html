Less than 24 hours later, Tuiasosopo decided to kill off Lennay.</p><p>Hours before her 'death', she sent a message to Manti's dad Brian to express her condolences.</p><p>In an emotional speech that same day, Manti told crowds at a Notre Dame game that he was dedicating his season to his late girlfriend and grandmother.</p><p>He also revealed that he couldn’t attend her funeral because of a vow he'd made to Lennay.</p><p>In a CBS This Morning interview, Manti recalled her saying: “Babe, if anything happens to me, you promise that you'll stay there and you'll play and you'll honour me through the way you play.”</p><h2>'Pain, grief and affection was real'</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/NINTCHDBPICT000753114771.jpg><p>The reality was, Tuiasosopo had brought the con to an abrupt end by faking Lennay's death after realising she wanted to “move on with life”.</p><p>She explained: “I had to start just living and let this go.”</p><p>In December 2012, Manti received a shocking phone call telling him Lennay wasn’t dead – and a month later, a report by Deadspin revealed she'd never existed at all.</p><p>The sportsman was caught in the crossfire, accused of being in on the scam to manipulate fans’ emotions - allegations he firmly denied.</p><p>The pain was real. The grief was real. The affection was real – and that’s the nature of this sad, cruel game</p><span class=quote-credit>Jack Swarbrick, Manti Te'o's coach</span><p>Later, Notre Dame’s athletic director Jack Swarbrick told a press conference: “It was real to Manti. There was no suspicion that it wasn’t.</p><p>"The pain was real. The grief was real. The affection was real – and that’s the nature of this sad, cruel game."</p><p>Manti admitted he found it “incredibly embarrassing to talk about” and told ESPN: “I obviously should have been much more cautious.”</p><p>Concerned his career could have been derailed by the bombshell, he warned others to be "far more guarded" when talking to strangers online.</p><h2>‘I'll never forgive her’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Screenshot-2022-08-12-at-17.04.02.png><p>Later, Diane O'Meara was revealed as the woman whose pictures were stolen and used on Lennay's various social media profiles.</p><p>She only became aware of the hoax after being told about her photos being used on fundraising pages - including one that raised $3,000 (£2,500) for leukaemia research.</p><p>Diane told NBC’s Today show: “It’s very bizarre and it’s a very twisted and confusing scenario… she literally has been stalking my Facebook and stealing my photos."</p><p>Tuiasosopo apologised to her former classmate over the phone - but Diane admitted: “I don’t think there’s anything she can say to me that would fix this.”</p><p>Tuiasosopo now goes by the name Naya – while Manti married fitness influencer Jovi Nicole in an intimate beach ceremony in September 2020.
