"I thought I would hear something, that they’d contact me and get a bit more detail… it was surprising that they never."</p><p>They said they’d get in touch with me if they needed me.

However a post-mortem was only carried out on the body three days later, at Ayr Hospital.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/body-beach-body-1-david-829681659.jpg><p>The autopsy recorded no significant injuries or evidence of trauma, and the doctor recorded death due to drowning. But questions were raised when Annie's body was returned to Sweden.</p><p>Gun Daneberg, who has worked in the funeral industry for 38 years, says she opened the coffin and was struck by "finger marks around her neck" and extensive bruising on her body "like someone had hit her".</p><p>“I have never experienced anything like this before. You don’t forget," she says. "I&nbsp;think the family were in a state of shock... she couldn’t have caused all those bruises herself."</p><p>Ms Daneberg also says Annie's long hair - seen in the CCTV footage of her in her final hours - had been roughly cut short, and there was a bald patch on her head "as though someone had grabbed it and just pulled it out".</p><h2>Mysterious bruising</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/04-07-2023-829674721.jpg><p>In the documentary Hazel discovers Annie’s body was handled by another undertaker in London, who collected Annie’s body before it was sent to Sweden.</p><p>In a letter, they state the condition of her body was “extremely poor”, adding that Annie “did have significant bruising to her body which for reasons I cannot explain, I believe were not included in the autopsy report”.</p><p>It added: “I find this to be quite unusual considering the circumstances of her death.”</p><p>Tests on Annie’s body found microscopic creatures that appear to have come from a freshwater environment, not salt water - odd, given the coastal location where he she was found.</p><p>A freedom of information request submitted by Hazel for the photos taken during Annie's first postmortem is refused due to them not being "in the public interest".</p><p>I have never experienced anything like this before. You don’t forget. I&nbsp;think the family were in a state of shock... she couldn’t have caused all those bruises herself</p><span class=quote-credit>Gun Daneberg</span><p>Hazel says Annie's family have also previously requested them and been denied because it wasn't deemed to be "in the family's interest".</p><p>Annie's best friend Maria Jansson, who was preparing to host her during her trip, is convinced Annie's death was not suicide, and that she was "murdered".</p><p>Her family, who took photos of the bruising, believe she was beaten and drowned, with her body then placed on the beach to look like suicide.</p><p>Hazel also questions why Annie would travel to a beach 80 miles away from her home, where the water in the bay is so shallow you have to walk out half a mile to reach a depth where you can no longer stand, to end her life.</p><p>However, retired detective Michael Neill points out a lot of families "can’t accept their loved one has taken their own life".</p><p>"There was never anything at all in the whole investigation to indicate that there was any criminality involved in Annie’s death," he says.</p><h2>Rugby player mystery</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/annie-kristina-borjesson-sweden-died-641024.jpg><p>Delving further, Hazel hears from Annie's friends about a rugby player she'd met in a nightclub not long before she died.</p><p>He told her his name was Martin Leslie, a Scottish-capped international originally from New Zealand.</p><p>However, when Annie claimed to have met him, the real Martin Leslie was back living in New Zealand.</p><p>The man she spoke to - who Annie described as very "full-on" to the point where it made her feel "uneasy" - has never been tracked down.</p><p>Annie told her family she feared the man was a "sexual predator", after he turned up at her local swimming pool in the days before her death, and said she planned to cut off contact.</p><h2>Suspected 'CIA cover-up'</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/04-07-2023-829674867.jpg><p>Another mystery surrounds Annie's phone records. Police claimed she had received no calls in the three days before her death.</p><p>But her mum called her on December 1, concerned for Annie's well-being.</p><p>A friend of Annie's from Scotland insists the call "did happen", as she was in the room, and claims she heard her tell her mum: "You have to respect this, I have to take care of myself."</p><p>Fellow journalist Robert Mulhern says there are elements of Annie’s case that make him “uneasy”.</p><p>Two days before her death, Annie called her family in Sweden from a payphone to say she was worried someone was listening to her mobile phone calls.</p><p>If you have nothing to hide here, then show us everything you have</p><span class=quote-credit>Robert Mulhern, journalist</span><p>Annie, whose middle name was Kristina, shares her name with an Emmy-award winning US journalist called Kristina Borjesson, who built a reputation on investigating the secret services in <a href=#>America</a>.</p><p>During the war on <a href=#>terror</a>, US intelligence secretly flew terrorist suspects around the world.</p><p>At the time that Annie was found dead, it was reportedly an “open secret” that the American government were relocating prisoners from the <a href=#>Middle East,</a> through Prestwick Airport, to prisons like <a href=#>Guantanamo Bay</a>.</p><p>Mr Mulhern says Kristina was a “thorn in the side” of the CIA to the point that she was “run out of really high profile jobs”.</p><p>He adds that people have put two and two together and suspect Annie was killed in a case of mistaken identity by agents of the US State.</p><h2>'State secret'</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2007-mum-guje-borjesson-poses-829676546.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/11-07-2023-829674833.jpg><p>In a final twist, Hazel discovers Mr Mulhern asked to see correspondence between the Scottish and Swedish government regarding Annie’s death.</p><p>But he was refused, as they claimed releasing any material relating to Annie could “harm their relations with a foreign state”.</p><p>The Swedish government has marked Annie’s case as a "classified state secret".</p><p>“Classified documents in relation to a straightforward drowning? That doesn’t add up. Why mark them top secret?” Mr Mulhern asks.</p><p>“If you have nothing to hide here, then show us everything you have.”</p><h2>'Mental health issues'</h2><p>While Annie's friends from Sweden describe the keen singer as a "happy go lucky" character, witness statements from Annie’s flatmates in Scotland paint a different picture.</p><p>One claimed she got the impression Annie was depressed because she couldn’t get a job, and was “very lonely”.</p><p>Another flatmate said she’d had to move out because “Annie became too much” and it had become stressful to be with her because she was so “pushy and intense”.</p><p>Another flatmate said Annie told her she had made “a decision that would change her life” three days before she was found dead.</p><p>It led police to suspect Annie struggled with mental health issues, and that her life in Scotland was not as she’d described it to her family back home.</p><p>Hazel’s findings have been passed to The Scottish Fatalities Investigation Unit. She says: "Regardless of Annie's state of mind in the lead-up to her death, these big questions remain unanswered, and they need to be addressed."</p><p>A representative of Police Scotland said: “We understand how distressing this must be for family and friends. Annie Borjesson’s death was fully investigated at the time and has also&nbsp; been subject of review.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>“There is no information or evidence at this time to suggest that there is any criminality surrounding Annie’s death.”</p><p><strong>Body on the Beach: What Happened to Annie? is available to stream now on BBC iPlayer.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/04-07-2023-829674719.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZ396f49uaWtnkaO7qrGMm6aropWowLC6jJumnbFdpLtursSamqFlo5i8tbjAp5tmpamowaa%2B2Gg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fannie-borjesson-body-on-beach-scotland-mystery.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fannie-borjesson-body-on-beach-scotland-mystery.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fannie-borjesson-body-on-beach-scotland-mystery.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fannie-borjesson-body-on-beach-scotland-mystery.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fannie-borjesson-body-on-beach-scotland-mystery.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fannie-borjesson-body-on-beach-scotland-mystery.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./usher-terry-raymond-iv.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./usher-terry-raymond-iv.html>Usher Hollywood Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./ireland-baldwin-shares-photos-daughter-fruit-themed-nursery-7550530.html>Ireland Baldwin Shares Look at Daughter's Fruit-Themed Nursery: Photo</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./ireland-baldwin-shares-photos-daughter-fruit-themed-nursery-7550530.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
