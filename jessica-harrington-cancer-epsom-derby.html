I’ll most likely watch the Derby from home but if I feel OK I could yet make a surprise visit.”</p><p>Whether she is watching on the box or from the stands, she has a right chance on her hands in the shape of Sprewell.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/4e236d35-220d-4901-a624-c5535af1e239.jpg><p>The improving three-year-old put himself front and centre in the Derby picture with an easy win in the Derrinstown last time.</p><p>When the Harrington family most needed a lift, along came the son of Churchill to book his ticket to the world’s most famous race.</p><p>Harrington said: “I’ve been delighted with him. We knew he’d come on over the winter and he’s run two solid races.</p><p>“He’s come out of the Leopardstown run very well and we were delighted with him. He definitely stepped forward from there again and we’re looking forward to the race.</p><p>“I think the step up to a mile and a half will suit him, he ran through the line very strong at Leopardstown and he’s a very strong and relaxed horse, which is the main thing.</p><p>“Nothing seems to faze him and I think going the mile and a half will suit him because I think he’ll settle well, which he had done in both of his races this year.</p><p>“He’s done everything we hoped he would do.”</p><p>The ground was very soft at Leopardstown so the only slight question mark remains over his ability to handle the likely quicker ground on the Downs.</p><p>Harrington isn’t worried though.</p><p>And given what she’s been through, the weather is the last thing on her mind.</p><p>She added: “I think they all go on quicker ground once. He’s actually a very low moving and good moving horse so I see no reason why he wouldn’t run well.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>“It’s just out of circumstances that he’s run on soft ground all four starts, because it was a wet autumn in Ireland and then we’ve had a wet spring.</p><p>“Whatever happens, he’s in great form and, needless to say, it would be very special if he won.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZH9zgZRpbXBuX5%2BytL%2FInJhmoJGnv6q6xq2mp2WTlruksdFmnKmrn6J6pbHRm7Bo</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjessica-harrington-cancer-epsom-derby.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjessica-harrington-cancer-epsom-derby.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjessica-harrington-cancer-epsom-derby.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjessica-harrington-cancer-epsom-derby.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjessica-harrington-cancer-epsom-derby.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjessica-harrington-cancer-epsom-derby.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./greg-horan.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./greg-horan.html>Greg Horan</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./ariel-winter-sides-with-kim-kardashian-no-one-shamed-justin-biebers-nude-photo-w166610.html>Ariel Winter Sides With Kim Kardashian: No One Shamed Justin Bieber's Nude Photo</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./ariel-winter-sides-with-kim-kardashian-no-one-shamed-justin-biebers-nude-photo-w166610.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
