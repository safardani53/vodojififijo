<time>02 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>PROTECTING your face from the sun is one of the most effective moves you can make to prevent skin cancer and signs of ageing, so it's important to have one of the best face sunscreens in your arsenal.</p><p>Summer is just around the corner, so it's prime time to restock your SPF stash with all the latest launches. However, <span>SPF creams are not just for holidays — you should be slathering SPF on your face all year round to keep wrinkles, dark spots and pigmentation at bay, and protect your skin from more serious damage.</span></p><p>Doesn't that sound appealing to you? The good news is, in 2023 there's now a whole host of dreamy-face SPFs out there. Yes, it is possible to find an SPF that won't bring you up in spots, cause a white cast or leave your skin feeling greasy. In fact, most of the best face sunscreens are now lightweight and formulated to work with your makeup and skincare (and some even go on top of your makeup).</p><p>So without further ado, we've rounded up the best facial sunscreens that you'll want to wear whatever the weather.</p><h2>Best face sunscreens at a glance:</h2><h2>Bioré UV Aqua Water Essence Sunscreen SPF50</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/IMG_0989.jpg><ul><li><strong>Bioré UV Aqua Water Essence Sunscreen SPF50, £15.99 from Superdrug - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Pros: </strong>SPF 50, doesn't pill, absorbs fast, UVA and UVB protection, oil-free, lightweight, doesn't clog pores, no white cast, contains moisturising ingredients</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> None</p><p><strong>Rating: </strong>5/5</p><p>You might how Bioré from its bestselling blackhead-removing pore strips. but it's actually the number one SPF brand in Japan. With that in mind, we had high hopes for this watery SPF. It's oil-free, which means it shouldn't clog your pores or feel greasy on the surface of your skin. It also claims to be lightweight and hydrating (thanks to the added hyaluronic acid), and we agree with all of these claims. After testing this SPF for a week on oily skin, there were no new breakouts — which is a problem often caused by most SPFs.</p><p>The cream looks like a regular sun cream, it's white and looks slightly thicker than your average moisturiser. However, it absorbed into the skin and the texture felt more watery. This SPF behaves like a regular hydrating moisturiser, and the finish is totally sheer, leaving no white cast.</p><p>One of my pet peeves about facial SPF is the way it disturbs makeup application. However, this one is a pleasure to use under makeup — it didn't pill or change the appearance of base makeup or affect how long it lasts. Plus, it's affordable and has a sun protection factor of 50.</p><p><strong>SPF:</strong> 50, <strong>Finish:</strong> Sheer, <strong>Protection:</strong> UVA and UVB</p><h2>SUQQU Protecting Day Cream SPF50+</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/IMG_0990.jpg><ul><li><strong>SUQQU Protecting Day Cream SPF50+, £48 from Cult Beauty - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here&nbsp;</a></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Pros:</strong>&nbsp;Lightweight, SPF50, UVA and UVB protection, added skincare ingredients, glowy finish</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Expensive</p><p><strong>Rating: </strong>5/5</p><p>There's no denying it, SUQQU's SPF is pricey at nearly £50 for 30ml. However, we'd argue that it's one of the best SPFs ever to wear under makeup in place of a primer. It's silky and astoundingly lightweight, making it feel like you have nothing on your skin at all. Plus, it contains bilberry, olive leaf extract, green tea and horsetail plant extract to moisturise your skin and leave you glowing. We'd wear this as a step in my makeup routine even if it didn't contain sun protection, that's how pretty it is on the skin.</p><p>You wouldn't expect a product from a luxury beauty brand that predominantly sells makeup to be as functional as it is aesthetically pleasing (look at that stunning packaging). But, it is. It has SPF 50 and will protect you against UVA and UVB rays.</p><p>Because it's expensive, reserve this SPF for fancy days out when you need makeup to look flawless.</p><p><strong>SPF:</strong> 50, <strong>Finish:</strong> Satin, <strong>Protection:</strong> UVA and UVB</p><p><strong>READ MORE:</strong></p><h2>ATHLETIA Skin Protection UV gel SPF30 and SPF50</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/IMG_2957.png><ul><li><strong>ATHLETIA Skin Protection UV gel SPF30 and SPF50, £26.40 (for SPF30) or £38 (for SPF50) from Selfridges or Athletia-beauty.co.uk - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a> and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">here</a></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Pros: </strong>SPF 30 or 50, UVA and UVB protection, lightweight gel texture, non-greasy, hydrates skin, eco-conscious, reef-friendly</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> None</p><p><strong>Rating: </strong>5/5</p><p>Big fan of SUQQU's facial SPF? Say hello to ATHLETIA, SUQQU's Japanese sister brand. These two SPFs have the same formula but different levels of UVA and UVB sun protection, so it's up to you which one you choose. We tried both, and were impressed with how quickly the lightweight gel sunk into our skin. And, we loved the pretty satin finish it left on our skin, which he found made an excellent base for makeup.</p><p>When an SPF claims to be hydrating, this can often be a red flag for people with oily skin. But, this SPF genuinely is moisturising rather than greasy or tacky. It contains hydrating ingredients like Athletia Energetic Complex (Ashitaba, Shiso, Rice extracts), uji green tea extracts and liquorice root extract to quench thirsty skin.</p><p>It also feels really cool and soothing on the skin, and has a really refreshing smell (thanks to the added lemon, rosemary, grapefruit and cedarwood fragrance).</p><p>You're not harming the environment either, since it is coral reef safe and the packaging is recyclable and eco-conscious.</p><p><strong>SPF:</strong> 30 or 50, <strong>Finish:</strong> Satin, <strong>Protection:</strong> UVA and UVB</p><h2>Peter Thomas Roth Water Drench SPF30</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/IMG_4169.jpg><ul><li><strong>Peter Thomas Roth Water Drench SPF30, £55 from Beauty Bay - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Pros:</strong> UVA and UVB protection, non-greasy, super hydrating, reduces signs of ageing, absorbs within seconds</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> SPF30 not SPF50</p><p><strong>Rating: </strong>5/5</p><p>Here at The Sun, we're huge fans of the Peter Thomas Roth Water Drench range, so we were thrilled to hear the news about this new addition. The brand's Water Drench SPF30 doesn't have the same bouncy gel-like consistency as its moisturiser, mask and eye cream, but it has the same weightless texture and invisible finish.</p><p>Besides shielding your skin against UVA and UVB rays, this SPF has a 30% compelx of hyaluronic acid. In other words, it hydrates and plumps the skin intensely and prevents water loss while being exposed to the sun.</p><p>That's not the only skin-loving ingredient it contains, either. Teaming up with hydrating hyaluronic acid, the product incorporates Pentavitin to delivery up to 72 hours of hydration to your skin. Yes, even after you've washed off your makeup for the day. It's a miracle ingredient.</p><p>On top of that, the ingredients list boasts 5% SunBoost ATB (proprietary ratio of antioxidants, anti-irritant and anti-inflammatory agents that can act as an SPF booster) to boost sun protection, and ceramide and ProHyal+ to reduce signs of ageing (e.g. fine lines and wrinkles).</p><p>And as for the finish, you won't even notice you've got SPF on. It looks more like a dewy primer and makes for an excellent makeup base before concealer or foundation. All in all, this SPF is an absolute dream.</p><p><strong>SPF:</strong> 30; <strong>Finish:</strong> Dewy, <strong>Protection:</strong> UVA and UVB</p><h2>Evolve Organic Beauty Climate Defence Facial Cream SPF30</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/IMG_2958-copy.png><ul><li><strong>Evolve Organic Beauty Climate Defence Facial Cream SPF30, £29 from Evolve Organic Beauty - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Pros:</strong> UVA and UVB protection, non-greasy, super hydrating, reef-friendly</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> SPF30 not SPF50, takes a while to sink in</p><p><strong>Rating: </strong>4/5</p><p>This is one of the richer and creamier sun lotions in the roundup meaning it takes a little longer to massage into the skin, but don't let that put you off. A few extra seconds massaging is worth it to reap the benefits of all the added moisturising ingredients in this SPF. Containing lingonberry stem cells to protect against the damaging effects of sun radiation and free radicals, prickly pear cactus extract to hydrate and soothe, and hyaluronic acid to firm, plump, and hydrate, this SPF will improve the appearance and feel of your skin instantly and in the long term with continued use.</p><p>It's also a little different from a lot of the other SPFs in the list because it's zinc oxide based, meaning it is a mineral or physical sunscreen that works by deflecting the UV rays away from the skin rather than absorbing them like chemical SPFs. Typically, mineral sunscreens are thought to be more environmentally friendly because they are usually reef friendly like this one.</p><p>We have oily skin so we popped ours on directly after cleansing, toning and applying a light serum, skipping our regular moisturiser, and felt super hydrated all day long. Even if you've got dry skin, this cream is so hydrating that you may not even need to use a moisturiser, but it's possible to layer up underneath if needs be.</p><p><strong>SPF:</strong> 30; <strong>Finish:</strong> Dewy, <strong>Protection:</strong> UVA and UVB</p><h2>Coola Refreshing Water Cream Sunscreen SPF50</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/IMG_2962.png><ul><li><strong>Coola Refreshing Water Cream Sunscreen SPF50, £45 from SpaceNK - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Pros:</strong> UVA and UVB protection, non-greasy, blue light and pollution protection, super hydrating ingredients, reef-friendly, recyclable packaging, vegan and gluten free, hygienic packaging</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> None</p><p><strong>Rating: </strong>5/5</p><p>This SPF is the ultimate skincare and sun protection product in one. It has SPF50 to protect you against UVA and UVB, and is powered by the brand's plant-derived BlueScreen Digital De-Stress technology, which protects against blue light, infrared light and pollution.</p><p>It doesn't just contain a few skincare ingredients to avoid drying out your skin, either. It's intensely hydrating and we'd wear this product if it had sun protection in it or not. Infused with hyaluronic acid and coconut water, the cream leaves your skin looking dewy, fresh and nourished and feeling super soft. Unlike a lot of SPF moisturisers, it isn't greasy, sticky or oily, and it absorbs within seconds and with very little effort. To top it all off, it's vegan-friendly, cruelty-free, the ingredients are 70%+ certified organic, and it's free from synthetic fragrance and other nasties too. The dispenser means you don't have to dip your fingers into the pot too, which makes the process much more hygienic whether you're applying at home or on the go. It really does tick every single box.</p><p>Even Skincare Queen and qualified advanced aesthetician <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Caroline Hirons</a> approves of this product, and the other newly released Coola products.</p><p><strong>SPF:</strong> 50, <strong>Finish:</strong> Dewy, <strong>Protection:</strong> UVA and UVB</p><h2>Coola Day SPF30+ Night Eye Cream Duo</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/IMG_2965.png><ul><li><strong>Coola Day SPF30+ Night Eye Cream Duo, £45 from SpaceNK - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Pros:</strong> UVA and UVB protection, 24-hour protection, blue light and pollution protection, recyclable packaging, vegan-friendly, comes with application spatula,&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> None</p><p><strong>Rating: </strong>5/5</p><p>Who said sun protection was only for the day time? This clever eye cream duo will give you 24 hour protection from UVA, UVB, blue light, pollution, and fatigue. Using vitamin C and SPF30, the day cream will help to reduce the look of dark circles and fine lines, slow down skin ageing. The night cream is infused with resveratrol, which is an antioxidant, is anti-inflammatory and will help to increase firmness and elasticity. The application spatula feels really cooling on the skin too, which helps to wake us up in the morning and calm down puffy and tired eyes at night.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/IMG_2964.png><p>The day cream feels like a regular eye cream but the night cream is thicker and more like a balm or a mask, which makes it a real treat to use before bed.</p><p>We've been using this product for the last few days and are already noticing a change in our under eyes. There's definitely a reduction in dark circles, fine lines appear to be minimised and overall we just look a little more awake. Bravo, Coola.</p><p>The only problem we had was remembering which was which, but once you've got it in your head that the peach is for the day and the purple for the night, this product is flawless.</p><p><strong>SPF:</strong> 30, <strong>Finish:</strong> Dewy, <strong>Protection:</strong> UVA and UVB</p><h2>Coola Classic Sunscreen Stick SPF in Tropical Coconut</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/IMG_2967.png><ul><li><strong>Coola Classic Sunscreen Stick SPF in Tropical Coconut, £23 from Next - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Pros:</strong> UVA and UVB protection, recyclable packaging, vegan-friendly, portable size, lightweight, invisible finish, full of antioxidants, natural coconut scent</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> None</p><p><strong>Rating: </strong>5/5</p><p>For the days where you're rushing through a list of errands and don't have an SPF cream to hand, this is your saviour. From now on, we'll be keeping this SPF30 sunscreen stick on us 24/7 for rapid top-ups.&nbsp; It's roughly palm-sized, will take up almost no space in your handbag, it is invisible, feather-weight and leaves you with no white cast, so there's absolutely no excuses when it comes to reapplication.</p><p>It has an SPF of 30, protects you against UVA and UVB rays, fights against free radicals, and will give your skin a healthy dose of antioxidants to nourish and hydrate your skin.</p><p>Because of its small size, we'd recommend using this only on your face. It's not advised that you use this on top of makeup, but we've been using it on days where we're wearing exclusively lip and eye makeup and it works a treat. Oh, and it has the dreamiest tropical coconut scent that makes reapplication almost addictive. Just remember to reapply every two hours.</p><p><strong>SPF:</strong> 30, <strong>Finish:</strong> Invisible, <strong>Protection:</strong> UVA and UVB</p><h2>Coola Classic Face Mist SPF50</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/IMG_2894.png><ul><li><strong>Coola Classic Face Mist SPF50, £32 from Space NK - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Pros:</strong> UVA and UVB protection, SPF50, apply over or under makeup, recyclable packaging, vegan-friendly, portable size, lightweight, invisible finish, full of antioxidants</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> None</p><p><strong>Rating: </strong>5/5</p><p>SPF face mists that you can reapply over makeup are a relatively new and rare thing, so this one from Coola is a pretty big deal. We've been applying our SPF as normal in the mornings and relying on this mist to top up our sun protection throughout the day, and it's made our lives so much easier. The reality is, a lot of us want to wear makeup on a daily basis, and we often forgo SPF touch-ups in favour of keeping our foundation and concealer on. This product allows us to prioritise both maintaining a perfectly painted face and protecting our skin against UVA and UVB rays.</p><p>Even better, we found this mist to wake up our slowly fading makeup and make our complexions look a little dewier and brighter. This is probably down to the fact that the process of applying it actually cools you down and makes you feel less sweaty, and the formula contains hydrating and skin-boosting ingredients like Buriti Oil and Prickly Pear extract. So, this product is another permanent resident of our handbag this summer.</p><p><strong>SPF:</strong> 30, <strong>Finish:</strong> Invisible, <strong>Protection:</strong> UVA and UVB</p><h2>Clinique Moisture Surge SPF25 Sheer Hydrator</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/IMG_2968.png><ul><li><strong>Clinique Moisture Surge SPF25 Sheer Hydrator, £44 from Look Fantastic - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>Clinique's Moisture Surge is one of the brand's most popular product. And just when you thought it couldn't get better, this version of the product just happens to have SPF of 25 to protect you against UVA and UVB rays while you soak up the product's powerfully hydrating ingredients.</p><p>Where the OG has a weightless gel-cream texture, this one feels a little heavier and cloud-like, and the only difference in terms of the key skincare ingredients is the lack of vitamins C and E (which you can add into your regime through serums, anyway).</p><p>Containing an aloe bioferment and a HA Complex, you'll notice that this&nbsp; moisturiser really does plump your skin and give it a healthy glow. It also uses provitamin D to protect your skin's barrier function from environmental damage. Essentially, it's a recipe for healthy, hydrated skin.</p><p>While many dermatologists recommend that you wear an SPF of 30 or more, everybody has got to start somewhere. And actually, SPF25 blocks 96% of UVB rays, which is only 1% less than SPF30. In both cases, you'll need to reapply at minimum every two hours anyway. We've been using this as our regular moisturiser and SPF combined as the last step of our skincare regime, applying our makeup, and then topping up our SPF with an SPF mist throughout the day.</p><h2>Ultrasun SPF50+ Tinted Face Sun Cream</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/IMG_0991.jpg><ul><li><strong>Ultrasun SPF50+ Tinted Face Sun Cream, £20.80 (down from £26) from Look Fantastic - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Pros: </strong>SPF 50, tinted, UVA and UVB protection, oil-free, lightweight, non-greasy, hydrates skin, protects against UVA and UVB</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> None</p><p><strong>Rating: </strong>5/5</p><p>If you're looking for a product that contains your sun protection, skincare and makeup (well, sort of), go for this one. It'll protect you against UVA, UVB and infrared radiation while hydrating your skin and reducing the appearance of lines, wrinkles and pores. It is a tinted sun cream too, which means it has a warm colour rather than the bright white colour of regular sun cream.</p><p>We found this SPF to be lightweight and non-greasy and made skin look soft and smooth. The tint didn't act as a replacement for foundation or concealer and it didn't add enough colour for us to ditch bronzer, but it did give a pretty glow. Overall, it was enjoyable to use and we'd reach for it all year long.</p><p><strong>SPF:</strong> 50, <strong>Finish:</strong> Glowy, <strong>Protection:</strong> UVA and UVB</p><h2>Trinny London BFF Cream Skin Perfector SPF30</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/IMG_1203-2-copy.png><ul><li><strong>Trinny London BFF Cream Skin Perfector SPF30, £39.00 from Trinny London - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Pros: </strong>SPF 30, tinted, UVA and UVB protection, lightweight, non-greasy, blends easily, contains antioxidants, no white cast</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> None</p><p><strong>Rating: </strong>5/5</p><p>I'm a huge fan of Trinny London's BFF Cream Skin Perfector SPF30 because it's so much more than an SPF product. Every time I wear it, I feel as if I need less makeup and I almost always get compliments on my skin. The cream is white when you pump it out, but as soon as you start blending it into your skin you'll notice that it has a really subtle tint. SPFs with tints can often be tricky to blend and will leave dodgy streaks where the product stops, but this one sinks in effortless and blends perfectly with your skin tone. It doesn't just provide a little bit of coverage, it also tones down redness and adds a glow (thanks to the added antioxidants)</p><p>This summer, I'll be using about two pumps all over, heading straight out with a bare face and touching up throughout the day.</p><p><strong>SPF:</strong> 30, <strong>Finish:</strong> Sheer coverage and glowy, <strong>Protection:</strong> UVA and UVB</p><h2>COSRX Aloe Soothing Sun Cream SPF50</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/IMG_1368.png><ul><li><strong>COSRX Aloe Soothing Sun Scream SPF50, £14.40 to £25.99 from Renude or Look Fantastic- <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a> or <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">here</a></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Pros: </strong>SPF 50 PA+++, UVA and UVB protection, creamy and hydrating, sinks in quickly, contains aloe vera, no white cast</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> None</p><p><strong>Rating: </strong>5/5</p><p>South Korean beauty brand CosRX started out as a small indie brand in 2013, but is now hugely popular on the K Beauty scene and beyond for its simple packaging and use of unique ingredients like snail mucin.</p><p>This SPF contains aloe vera, which has cooling and anti-inflammatory properties to soothe sunburn and reduce the appearance of blemishes and wrinkles.

Because of this addition, I always skip my hyaluronic acid serum and apply this SPF either alone or with another lightweight serum or moisturiser. I love that it gives you a slightly dewy finish, but not so much that you feel greasy or your makeup slips off.</p><p>As well as hydrating ingredients, the SPF also uses mistletoe extract to stimulate cellular turnover. In short, this means it encourages your skin to repair and renew after being exposed to the sun and oxidative stress. This is also useful if you have a few stubborn breakouts, like me.</p><p><strong>SPF:</strong> 50, <strong>Finish:</strong> Dewy, <strong>Protection:</strong> UVA and UVB</p><h2>SVR Laboratorie Dermatologique Sun Secure Blur Soft-Focus Mousse SPF50+</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/IMG_1370.png><ul><li><strong>Sun Secure Blur Soft-Focus Mousse SPF50+, £19 from Renude or £18 from Look Fantastic - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a> or <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Pros: </strong>SPF 50, UVA and UVB protection, lightweight, blurring mousse texture, apricot scent</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> None</p><p><strong>Rating: </strong>5/5</p><p>SVR Laboratorie Dermatologique is a French pharmacy brand that prides itself on making products that are gentle enough for even the most sensitive or problematic skin. The products are created by pharmacists and prescribed by doctors, so you know you're getting something super safe and effective with this SPF.</p><p>The standout feature of this product is that it has a magical mousse texture. The last time I put something with a mousse texture on my face was back in secondary school when Maybelline's Dream Matte Mousse foundation was all the rage, so I was a little sceptical about this product to begin with. However, I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome. I tried this SPF on a day where my skin was really irritated and breaking out and found that the blurring mousse helped to smooth over my spots and take down any redness. Plus, it worked as an excellent primer for makeup because it's water, sweat and rub-resistant so gripped onto my concealer all day long. It's summery apricot scent makes it really enjoyable to use, too.</p><p>Although it has a slight pinky-orange colour, this SPF is untinted and should be invisible on all complexions.</p><p>In terms of the actual sun protection, it'll protect you against UVA, UVB, blue light, and infrared and visible light, and is factor 50. You can't ask for much more than that, right?</p><p>This is now my favourite SPF to wear on days where my skin is breaking out and irritable but I don't want to wear lots of makeup and I still need to feel confident.</p><p><strong>SPF:</strong> 50, <strong>Finish:</strong> Matte, <strong>Protection:</strong> UVA, UVB and blue light.</p><h2>Paula's Choice Advanced Sun Protection Daily Moisturiser SPF 50</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/IMG_1208.jpg><ul><li><strong>Paula's Choice Advanced Sun Protection Daily Moisturiser SPF 50, £31.20 (down from £39) at Paula's Choice - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Pros: </strong>SPF 30, UVA and UVB protection, lightweight, non-greasy, dewy glow, hydrating, no white cast, holds your makeup in place</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> None</p><p><strong>Rating: </strong>5/5</p><p>Paula's Choice is a brand that I love for its exfoliants and serums, so it's no surprise that this brand new SPF is a delight to use as well.</p><p>It works against both UVA and UBV rays, which means you're preventing sun burn, skin cancer and related health concerns, and premature signs of ageing.</p><p>The thing that makes this SPF so unique is that it doesn't seep into the deeper layers of your skin and cause a sensitised response or breakouts. This is because its molecules are larger in size than other SPFs, this cream will sit on the two two layers of your skin. Clever, right?</p><p>Plus, it is non-greasy, leaves you with a dewy glow, and works as a primer alternative by allowing makeup to hold onto the skin's surface more easily.

For starters, it has SPF30 and protects against both UVA and UVB rays. What makes it special then? Both UVA and UVB rays damage your skin, just in different ways. UVB has a shorter wavelength and is associated with skin burning, and UVA has a longer wavelength and is more associated with skin ageing&nbsp; Some SPFs don't protect against UVA at all, meaning they will only stop you from burning and potentially developing skin cancer, but they don't focus as much on anti-ageing. This SPF actually has ultra-high 5* UVA defence, so you won't be able to find a product that products against UVA rays more effectively than this.</p><p>On top of the actual sun protection, the cream also has a pollution shield and anti-blue light technology. It also contains elastin, carnosine, and collagen to keep your skin looking supple and prevent fine lines, sagging and loss of elasticity.</p><p>When I first applied this product to my face, I was amazed at how quickly it sunk in. It doesn't leave a greasy or sticky finish, either. The finish is the perfect balance between matte and dewy, and the cream is quite hydrating and smoothing so it's great prep for makeup.</p><p><strong>SPF:</strong> 50, <strong>Finish:</strong> Invisible, <strong>Protection:</strong> UVA and UVB</p><h2>IMAGE Skincare Prevention+ Sun Serum SPF30 Untinted</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/IMG_1212.jpg><ul><li><strong>IMAGE Skincare Prevention+ Sun Serum SPF30 Tinted, £55 from IMAGE Skincare - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Pros: </strong>SPF 50, UVA and UVB protection, lightweight, non-greasy, tinted, no white cast</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Doesn't come in other shades</p><p><strong>Rating: </strong>5/5</p><p>I'm a longtime user of IMAGE Skincare's Salicylic Acid Gel Cleanser, but I'd never tried any of the brand's other products until now. The fact that this is an SPF serum rather than a cream meant that this product was immediately appealing to me because 'serum' normally implies added skin benefits — and that's the case with this one. Outside of protecting your skin from UVA and UVB rays, it delivers ingredients like squalane, ginger root extract, vitamin C, vitamin E and chamomile to your skin to moisturise, soothe and protect your skin against free radicals and environmental aggressors that lead to visible signs of ageing.</p><p>The serum also has a warm tint to it which is ideal for adding a bit of colour and coverage to my fair skin, but I can't say for sure how it'll show up on darker complexions. However, the product information does claim that the serum&nbsp; blends in "seamlessly" to most skin tones.</p><p>All in all, I'd say this is the perfect SPF if you're after one product that gives you your skincare, sun protection and&nbsp; makeup (in the form of a very subtle glowy tint) all in one.</p><p><strong>SPF:</strong> 30, <strong>Finish:</strong> Tinted, <strong>Protection:</strong> UVA and UVB</p><h2>Glow Hub Defend Yourself SPF30</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/IMG_0996.jpg><ul><li><strong>Glow Hub Defend Yourself SPF30, £12 from ASOS - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Pros: </strong>skincare ingredients, glowy finish, lightweight, UVA and UVB protection, no white cast, non-greasy, fragrance-free</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> None</p><p><strong>Rating: </strong>5/5</p><p>This SPF is our go-to for day-to-day use, whether we're working from home, meeting mates for coffee or commuting into the city for a long day in the office. The thing that sets this SPF apart from the rest is that it protects you against UVA and UVB rays but also acts as a powerful serum and leaves you with a glow — all for just £12.</p><p>We like to wear a serum packed with antioxidants and Vitamin E to protect against free radicals and pollution and hydrate my skin throughout the day, but this SPF actually contains both of these things. We liked wearing this SPF over regular moisturiser, before applying makeup (it layers nicely under makeup). On no-makeup days, reapply this every few hours throughout the day.</p><p>While SPF50 is ideal, dermatologists agree that an SPF of 30 is plenty.</p><p><strong>SPF:</strong> 3o, <strong>Finish:</strong> Glowy, <strong>Protection:</strong> UVA and UVB</p><h2>Coco & Eve Daily Water Gel SPF 50</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/IMG_1009.jpg><ul><li><strong>Coco & Eve Daily Water Gel SPF 50, £23 from Space NK - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here&nbsp;</a></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Pros: </strong>SPF 50, UVA and UVB protection, sinks in quickly, skin-loving ingredients, sits well under makeup</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> None</p><p><strong>Rating: </strong>5/5</p><p>If you've heard of Coco & Eve, you're probably familiar with the Australian brand's Instagram-famous hair mask.

It has factor 50+ and protects against UVA and UVA rays, and on top of that, it is full of hydrating ingredients like hyaluronic acid, aloe vera and vitamin E.</p><p>The thing we love the most about this was how easily it sinks into the skin.

The fact of the matter is, most of us think we're protecting our skin all day when we put our SPF lotion on our faces in the morning. However, we're not. Your SPF is only guaranteed to protect you for around two hours, even if you're indoors. The actual amount of time your SPF's power will last depends on how much sun exposure you're getting and whether or not you're sweating. Your SPF might be effective for four to six hours if you're working indoors and not sitting near a window, but you'll still need to top up after that. And if you're wearing makeup, you're definitely not going to want to remove your makeup to reapply. That's where this product comes into it.</p><p>It's a lightweight mist that you spritz gently over your skin to top up your SPF and deliver your skin with a boost of soothing and hydrating ingredients like niacinamide, Vitamin C and E, and aloe vera.</p><p>Not many SPF reapplication mists exist on the market, so this one is totally life-changing and we liked carrying it in our bags, making it super handy for summer. As well as protecting our skin,&nbsp; this mist freshens up makeup and gives a healthy glow when the skin is starting to look dull throughout the day. Plus, it's ideal for super hot days when your makeup is starting to slip and slide and you need to cool down.</p><p><strong>SPF:</strong> 50, <strong>Finish:</strong> Sheer, <strong>Protection:</strong> UVA and UVB</p><h2>Clarins Mineral Sun Care Compact SPF30</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/IMG_1013.jpg><ul><li><strong>Clarins Mineral Sun Care Compact SPF30, £31 from Clarins - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here&nbsp;</a></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Pros: </strong>tinted colour provides coverage, handy compact size, UVA and UVB protection, recycled packaging</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>applicator is ineffective, slightly greasy texture</p><p><strong>Rating: </strong>3/5</p><p>This compact SPF is really unique because you pump the product out and apply it with a silicone sponge.

However, the small size and sleek round shape make it easy to carry this product around with you.</p><p>The product itself has SPF 30 and is really lightweight and silky. The tinted colour does provide some coverage on your skin too, giving you the same effect as a really subtle tinted moisturiser.</p><p>This isn't one for people with really oily skin though as the finish is very dewy and you may feel a little greasy if you don't touch it up with powder.</p><p><strong>SPF:</strong> 30, <strong>Finish:</strong> Dewy, <strong>Protection:</strong> UVA and UVB</p><h2>Clarins Mineral Sun Care Fluid SPF30</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/IMG_1015.jpg><ul><li><strong>Clarins Mineral Sun Care Fluid SPF30, £24 from Sephora - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here&nbsp;</a></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Sweat and water-resistant, UVA and UVB protection, velvet finish, skincare ingredients</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>None</p><p><strong>Rating: </strong>3/5</p><p>This is one of the thinnest SPFs you'll find, and once it's on you really won't be able to tell it's there (minus the subtle velvet finish it leaves) That doesn't make it any less effective, though.

It's only thought of when going on holiday as the sun will be hotter and our skin is more likely to experience damage."</p><p>"However few know that UV rays affect our skin every day, even on rainy and cloudy days. Through a window at home or our car windscreen, these harmful rays damage our skin.</p><p>"UVA is present all year round. It penetrates the lower layers of our skin through to the dermis, mutating cells as they are being formed. UVA has now been seen to be a trigger and cause of skin cancer.</p><p>"UVB is present during the warmer months of the year and is responsible for sunburn and most skin cancer cases. Unlike UVA, it does not penetrate clouds or window glass."</p><h2>What should I look for when buying sunscreen?</h2><p>According to Dr Phillips: "using SPF every day is a must, however, it is important that you wear one containing broad-spectrum sun protection, as this protects you from UVA and UVB rays.</p><p>"As well as decreasing the risk of sunburn and premature ageing, wearing an SPF decreases your risk of developing skin cancer and massively reduces your melanoma risk and any damage to your body including pigmentation and sunspots.</p><p>"SPFs are packed with an assortment of antioxidants and hydrating ingredients to soften and care for the skin as it protects. So, whilst your SPF is working hard to protect against UVA and UVB rays, the antioxidants inside are also helping to defend against the free radicals and environmental aggressors that we are all exposed to daily."</p><h2>Where to buy sunscreen for faces in the UK</h2><p>You can buy sunscreen for faces from a wide range of shops in the UK, from supermarkets and pharmacies to designated beauty stores including:</p><h2>How much do face sunscreens cost?</h2><p>The price of an SPF for your face varies from brand to brand. But generally, you'll be able to get a decent facial sunscreen for around £15 to £40. There are more affordable options, like Glow Hub's £12 offering. Or, you can spend nearly £50 on a face SPF like SUQQU's. It all depends on preference and budget.</p><h2>What SPF is best for faces?</h2><p>Dermatologists recommend that everyone should wear at least SPF30, which allows around 3 percent of UVB rays into your skin.</p><p>To be extra safe, we recommend opting for SPF 50 and reapplying a few times a day.</p><h2>What does SPF do for your face?</h2><p>SPF stands for sun protection factor which is pretty self-explanatory.</p><p>However, not only does SPF protect from sun damage which can cause cancer, but it also helps to prevent signs of ageing like sagging, wrinkles and dark spots.</p><h2>Is SPF 15 enough protection for your face?</h2><p>For true protection, SPF 15 isn't enough. Dermatologists recommend using a minimum of SPF 30 but to be extra safe, opt for SPF 50.</p><p>The difference between SPF 30 and SPF 50 isn't as big as the numbers make it sound, but the change in the level of protection between SPF 30 and SPF 15 is significant.</p><h2>How much SPF should I apply on my face?</h2><p>Experts say that you should apply a teaspoon amount of SPF to your face, then reapply every two to three hours.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqysp2Wjmrmmr9OsZnFuZ22DdX2Om5ysrF2ovad5xaipZp6RmLK0ew%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbest-spf-for-faces.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbest-spf-for-faces.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbest-spf-for-faces.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbest-spf-for-faces.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbest-spf-for-faces.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbest-spf-for-faces.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./little-people-big-news-jacob-roloff-to-move-on-to-fathers-farm.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./little-people-big-news-jacob-roloff-to-move-on-to-fathers-farm.html>Jacob Roloff to Move on to Father's Farm!</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./who-is-dan-hampton-dating.html>Who is Dan Hampton Dating Now</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./who-is-dan-hampton-dating.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
