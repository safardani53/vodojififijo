I suppose the fact that it's a different clue set explains it but it's still funny."</p><p>And a fourth: "I’m pretty stunned Halley’s Comet was a Daily Double."</p><p>A fifth simply wrote: "Good job to Justin for doing the true Daily Double!"</p><p>Though the clues were completely different, on February 14th's game, Final Jeopardy under the <a href=#>category</a>: "Arts & Science" read:</p><p>"A craft that visited it was named for Giotto, based on the story that 680 years earlier, the painter depicted it as the Star of Bethlehem."</p><p><a href=#>Kendra Westerhaus</a>, who&nbsp;<a href=#>won the episode</a>, was the only one to get it right within the 30-second time frame with: "Halley's Comet." - some fans also clocked that clue as clunky given it was 26 words.</p><h2>FRUSTRATING FINAL JEOPARDY! CLUES</h2><p>Hardcore fans have been unhappy with the quality of <a href=#>Final Jeopardy clues lately.</a></p><p>Recently one under the category “Business Milestones” read: "These were first sold in 1908 at a price equivalent to about $27,000 today."</p><p>None of the contestants managed to give the correct answer: “What is: the Ford Model T?”</p><p><a href=#>Fans then not only slammed the clue as "vague"</a>&nbsp;but also spotted it asked for "these," but the desired response was singular, or one model.</p><p>Every day the Final Jeopardy clue is printed in The New York Times and in a rare move the clue actually was edited for clarity, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jeopardy.com.</a></p><p>Recently, the show’s&nbsp;producers also misspelled&nbsp;<a href=#>an Edgar Allan Poe quote</a>&nbsp;in Final Jeopardy.</p><p>And they caused wrath like no other with a&nbsp;<a href=#>King James bible question</a>&nbsp;fans fumed was flawed in its premise during the&nbsp;<a href=#>Tournament of Champions.</a></p><p>Even the fan-favorite Twitter account&nbsp;<a href=#>Jeopardy! Blind Guesser</a>, in which fans tweet at them with their Final Jeopardy guess based only on the category - had to buzz in recently.</p><p>They tweeted they were sitting out "blind guessing" for an episode because the Final Jeopardy was used "8 days ago."</p><h2>MIXED ON MAYIM</h2><p>This week marks the first time Mayim has hosted regular episodes this season and in five months instead of&nbsp;<a href=#>Ken Jennings</a>, 48.</p><p>Fans have made it no secret that it's been an adjustment, as the former 74-time champ lives and breathes&nbsp;<a href=#>Jeopardy!</a>.</p><p>Just four episodes in, outlets have run&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">headlines</a>&nbsp;like: "Mayim Bialik Is Almost Universally Despised As Jeopardy! Host."</p><p>Fans have simply made it clear they prefer Ken's hosting style, and Mayim also accepted a response on Monday that many&nbsp;<a href=#>deemed "incorrect"</a>&nbsp;for starters.</p><p>Another larger issue is&nbsp;<a href=#>Mayim's cadence; namely, her pause when deeming a contestant correct</a>&nbsp;or not on nearly every clue.</p><p><a href=#>Producers have revealed</a>&nbsp;that&nbsp;Ken will be back after&nbsp;Mayim's&nbsp;three-week tournament.</p><p>He'll return on Friday, Mar. 10 and that host stint is expected to last through at least April 14.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>This is welcome news for Ken-leaning legions as many were fearing he'd be off until next season, or September 2023.</p><p>The scheduling news could be an early indicator that Mayim will mostly stick to specials going forward.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/02/fans-slam-game-show-reusing-798036171.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/02/fans-slam-game-show-most-796244333-2.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/02/fans-slam-game-show-reusing-798038301.png><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hvZGyEdIWUaKGep6CWv6XFjKucrqaZpLtuwM6uqaeZnZq7tXnJrqqtoZ5ixKq6zZ6pZqWRrrauecGimKWhm2Q%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjeopardy-reunion-tournament-justin-winner-mayim-bialik.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjeopardy-reunion-tournament-justin-winner-mayim-bialik.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjeopardy-reunion-tournament-justin-winner-mayim-bialik.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjeopardy-reunion-tournament-justin-winner-mayim-bialik.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjeopardy-reunion-tournament-justin-winner-mayim-bialik.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjeopardy-reunion-tournament-justin-winner-mayim-bialik.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jessica-simpson-opens-up-about-buying-back-her-fashion-brand.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jessica-simpson-opens-up-about-buying-back-her-fashion-brand.html>Jessica Simpson Opens Up About Buying Back Her Fashion Brand</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./james-o-keefe.html>James O'Keefe Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./james-o-keefe.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
