The singer rode a bike that had a cart the girls were sitting in attached and looked as happy as could be. He wore a blue plaid top and loose ripped jeans during the fun, and his grey beard, helmet, and sunglasses had him looking almost unrecognizable.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/adam-levine-bike-ride-daughters-backgrid-excl-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>Dusty and Gio also wore helmets like their dad, and wore colorful patterned tops as they enjoyed the ride. The adrenaline rush appeared on their faces as they laughed and smiled throughout, proving they were having a great time. At one point, Adam was also photographed during a break in the ride and was standing outside without his helmet as his sunglasses were atop his head.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Adam’s latest outing with his daughters, whom he shares with wife <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Behati Prinsloo</strong></a>, comes after he made headlines for a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>flirting scandal</a> he was involved in. The <strong>Maroon 5</strong> frontman admitted to acting “inappropriate” but denied having an affair after OnlyFans model <strong>Sumner Stroh</strong> claimed they had a relationship during his marriage to Behati, who is currently expecting their third child. “I used poor judgment in speaking with anyone other than my wife in ANY kind of flirtatious manner,” Adam wrote on his <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> Story. “I did not have an affair, nevertheless, I crossed the line during a regrettable period of my life.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Adam-Levine-daughters-spl-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Since he admitted to flirting, Adam has seemed to work things out with Behati. The spouses have been seen <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>out and about</a> a lot with their daughters in the past few weeks and have often had big smiles on their faces despite the drama that’s recently surrounded them. The doting mom and dad <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>were photographed</a> on a bike ride similar to Adam’s latest one with his kids, and appeared calm as they bonded with their little ones.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>As far as the backlash the flirting scandal has brought him and his family, Adam is trying to do what he can to make sure he’s by Behati’s side, especially during her pregnancy. “The last thing that he ever wants is for her to be stressed out during her pregnancy and he feels so awful that this is happening,” an insider <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>EXCLUSIVELY told <strong>HollywoodLife</strong></a> last month. “Adam knows how close he came to losing everything and he is so incredibly thankful that she has not run away from him over this. He loves Behati and his kids so much. He just wants this to all be behind them.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ye49sZpqckaJ6rbHVoqWeZZensrp5wZ6Yq5xdl7assYyroJ2dXaC2pb%2BMqZ%2BorJ9k</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fadam-levine-grey-beard-bike-ride-kids-photo.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fadam-levine-grey-beard-bike-ride-kids-photo.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fadam-levine-grey-beard-bike-ride-kids-photo.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fadam-levine-grey-beard-bike-ride-kids-photo.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fadam-levine-grey-beard-bike-ride-kids-photo.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fadam-levine-grey-beard-bike-ride-kids-photo.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./neil-diamond-net-worth-wife-parkinsons-disease.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./neil-diamond-net-worth-wife-parkinsons-disease.html>How old is Neil Diamond, what's his net worth, who's his wife and what are his hit songs?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./ugly-betty-cancelled-mark-indelicato-sad-abc-show-america-ferrera.html>'Ugly Betty' Star Mark Indelicato Says He Is 'So Sad' The Show Is Cancelled!
