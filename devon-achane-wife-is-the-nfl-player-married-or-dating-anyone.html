<time>05 Mar 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><strong>Devon Achane doesn’t have a wife but has a girlfriend. The running back recently went public with his romance on his Instagram handle.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Achane shared a couple of photos with his girlfriend, whom he had previously kept a secret. It isn’t known when the two began dating, as his girlfriend has also recently started sharing pictures with him.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/devon-achane-dolphins.jpg><p>A third-round pick of the 2023 NFL Draft, Devon Achane played three years of collegiate football at Texas A&M. The 22-year-old had forgone his senior season and went ahead with the draft.</p><p>And it doesn’t look like it was the worst decision. Achane has settled himself in <a href=# rel=noopener>Mike McDaniel’s</a> side and recently even recorded a touchdown against the Buffalo Bills.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Devon Achane Wife: Is The NFL Player Married Or Dating Anyone?</h2><p>The NFL player Devon Achane doesn’t have a wife. But do not think he isn’t dating anyone. The youngster is in a relationship with a woman who hasn’t publicly stated her name.</p><p>On her Instagram, Devon’s girlfriend goes by the name “badgaaalnikki.” But in one of her posts, a follower has referred to her as Erica and Ms. Parker.&nbsp;</p><p>It isn’t known when Devon and his girlfriend started dating. Achane only recently went public with his romantic partner. On January 4, he shared a series of images, and in that mix, he had two pictures of him and his girlfriend.</p><p>Devon captioned the post, “Y’all prolly think I made it, but I didn’t, still tryna stack my paper to the ceiling.”</p><p>His partner also shared the same set of pictures on her <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram page</a> and captioned the post, “I won’t waste no time when it comes to you, put my pride aside give it all to you.”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/devon-achane-wife.jpg><p>Soon after she shared the post, Achane left a comment on his lover’s post and had a short exchange. It was on January 1 that his partner went public with their romance.&nbsp;</p><p>In the post shared by Devon’s partner, the two could be seen rocking Miami Dolphins gear. Devon was seen wearing the shirt, and his partner wore the Dolphins jacket.&nbsp;</p><p>She sweetly captioned the photos, “I love life with you.” Recently, Achane’s partner attended the NFL game against the Bills, and she shared a couple of Instagram stories.</p><p>The proud girlfriend reshared a video from the Dolphins Instagram page, which showed the exact moment Devon got the touchdown.&nbsp;</p><h2>Devon Achane Family&nbsp;</h2><p>The Miami Dolphins running back hasn’t given too many details about his family. There is a video of Devon celebrating with his family after being drafted earlier this year.</p><p>In the video, Devon is seen sitting alongside his mother, and his entire family is screaming with joy as his name is announced. On Instagram, Devon hasn’t shared any family-related posts.&nbsp;</p><p>Previously, in an interview taken after his college selection, Devon said his mother really liked the Aggies and the coaches, who made Devon feel at home.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/devon-achane-mother.jpg><p>Devon and his mom also participated in the summer recruiting barbeque and met all the coaches. Devon had announced for the NFL draft a year early and decided to return to complete his degree.&nbsp;</p><p>The running back said his mother helped him make the tough decision. His family felt he was ready to take the next step.&nbsp;</p><p>It is believed that Tresha Bennett is Devon’s mom. She is available on Instagram but has her account in private mode.&nbsp;</p><p>On <a href=# rel=noopener>Facebook</a>, Tresha has shared several posts about her son’s achievements and news related to him. In April, the proud mother shared the video of Devon receiving the phone call from the Dolphins organization.&nbsp;</p><p>She also shared the draft day video and captioned the post, “His biggest fan is his lil brother.” It isn’t known how many siblings Devon has, but going through Tresha’s post, Devon is the oldest of them all.&nbsp;</p><p>Previously, in 2020, on Devon’s 20th birthday, Tresha even gifted her son a car. It was an early birthday gift from Tresha to her oldest son, and Devon is probably already thinking of returning something just like it or even grander in the future for his mom.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmionJbGpr7Sm6CoZpOkunCwxK%2Bmp2WRmLWiusRmrqKelWK2tHnToZxmppaherG4wLKcq2Wdlr%2BztcSdZKiqXZmutbXNoGSapqmku6Z7</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdevon-achane-wife-is-the-nfl-player-married-or-dating-anyone.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdevon-achane-wife-is-the-nfl-player-married-or-dating-anyone.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdevon-achane-wife-is-the-nfl-player-married-or-dating-anyone.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdevon-achane-wife-is-the-nfl-player-married-or-dating-anyone.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdevon-achane-wife-is-the-nfl-player-married-or-dating-anyone.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdevon-achane-wife-is-the-nfl-player-married-or-dating-anyone.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./harry-jowsey-explains-buying-a-15k-bracelet-for-rylee-arnold.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./harry-jowsey-explains-buying-a-15k-bracelet-for-rylee-arnold.html>Harry Jowsey Explains Buying a $15k Bracelet for Rylee Arnold</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./kelly-ripa-mark-consuelos-no-secret-to-27-years-of-marriage-7546370.html>Theres No Secret' to 27-Year Mark Consuelos Marriage</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./kelly-ripa-mark-consuelos-no-secret-to-27-years-of-marriage-7546370.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
