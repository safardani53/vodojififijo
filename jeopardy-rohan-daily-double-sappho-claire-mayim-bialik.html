Which in hindsight, sealed his chances."</p><p>That's why you have to take your chance at the Daily Double as those are game changers!"</p><p>A third wrote: "Even though he didn't like the category, from a trailing position late in the game, he might have considered betting an amount such as $3,000."</p><p>"I love Rohan he’s pretty funny" wrote a fourth.</p><p>Over on Twitter one fan asked: "Why did Rohan bet $5.00 on Double Jeopardy?"</p><p>Another wrote: "And again - Ms Bialik the pauses after a correct DD response are aggravating!"</p><p>So far the semi-finalists of the new, ongoing tournament are Claire,&nbsp;<a href=#>Jackson Jones</a>, 2019 Teen Tournament winner Avi Gupta,&nbsp;<a href=#>Brown freshman Justin Bolsen</a>&nbsp;who became a fan-favorite with a bold Daily Double bet last Wednesday, and&nbsp;<a href=#>Maya Wright</a>, a senior at Emory.</p><p>The semi-finals will begin later this week as the students are dismissed and until three remain for a two-day total point affair finals.</p><p><a href=#>Stanford Senior Avi made a huge splash</a> during a Daily Double in his game when he got it and talked smack to second placer Jack Izzo: "You're not going to get rid of me that easy."</p><h2>HOST SCHEDULE SET IN STONE</h2><p>Last week marked the first time Mayim has hosted regular episodes this season instead of&nbsp;Ken Jennings, 48.</p><p>Fans have made it no secret that it's been an adjustment, as the former 74-time champ lives and breathes&nbsp;Jeopardy!.</p><p>Outlets have even run&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">headlines</a>&nbsp;like: "Mayim Bialik Is Almost Universally Despised As Jeopardy! Host."</p><p>One quantifiable issue with&nbsp;<a href=#>Mayim is her cadence; namely, her pause when deeming a contestant correct</a>&nbsp;or not on nearly every clue.</p><p>On Monday,<a href=#>longtime producer Sarah Foss</a>&nbsp;cleared the board on the <a href=#>hosting schedule for the rest of the season</a> on the show's <a href=#>podcast</a>.</p><p>It was announced that <a href=#>Ken</a> will be back after Mayim's three-week tournament, but not for very long.</p><p>"Ken Jennings will be back on March 10th and then he will continue the rest of his syndicated run which will take us through April 28th.</p><p>"Then Mayim will take over on May 1st and she’ll take us all the way through the summer."</p><p>Fans were left in a frenzy since after May 1st, we won't see Ken on the regular show until Season 40, or September 2023 - many daily viewers are begging the show to just let him host.</p><p>One PO-ed fan Tweeted upon the news: "Then I'll be in for a month and then promptly out. The Jeopardy audience does not consist of masochists who want to be force-fed a subpar product."</p><p>Another defended: "Alex Trebek believed the show was about the contestants, not the hosts."</p><p>To which a third wrote: "It's not about Ken, but it is about the flow of the show. I've watched since 1964,&nbsp;and it's a different show with Mayim. I won't watch and I won't disparage others who won't."</p><p>A fourth wrote: "Jeopardy, stop trying to make Mayim happen. It’s not going to happen."</p><p>Last year,&nbsp;<a href=#>Amy Schneider</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=#>Mattea Roach</a>&nbsp;stated in interviews they prefer Ken given he went from its winningest contestant (74 victories in 2004) to host, as did recent&nbsp;<a href=#>divisive three-day champ Jake Dearruda</a>&nbsp;slamming her as&nbsp;"inexperienced."</p><p>The consensus is <a href=#>Ken Jennings</a> has simply grown into the role, and even Mayim is aware of her mixed reception sharing on her podcast recently: "Sometimes I get, 'We don't prefer you to Ken.'"</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>The energy in the room seems to be that the sitcom star with no notable past ties to Jeopardy is doing perfectly well on&nbsp;specials like&nbsp;<a href=#>Celebrity Jeopardy!</a>, a former champion recently told&nbsp;The U.S. Sun <a href=#>she should stick to that</a>.</p><p>Ken will still be on-air for a bit hosting the new&nbsp;<a href=#>Jeopardy! Masters&nbsp;spinoff</a>, which is scheduled to air during the spring in primetime on ABC.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/02/4e1bb710-7a58-4495-a968-43701b1cca58.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/02/contestant-makes-rival-players-host-799101665.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/02/fans-shock-student-contestant-avi-797579344-1.png><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hvZWWCdHySaKGep6CWv6XFjKumoZmeYrGitcuyZJ2npZe5pnnSmqepoJ9isK2tyKucZqWRrrauecGimKWhm2Q%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjeopardy-rohan-daily-double-sappho-claire-mayim-bialik.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjeopardy-rohan-daily-double-sappho-claire-mayim-bialik.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjeopardy-rohan-daily-double-sappho-claire-mayim-bialik.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjeopardy-rohan-daily-double-sappho-claire-mayim-bialik.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjeopardy-rohan-daily-double-sappho-claire-mayim-bialik.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjeopardy-rohan-daily-double-sappho-claire-mayim-bialik.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./mike-phillips.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./mike-phillips.html>Mike Phillips</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./gabby-hayes.html>Gabby Hayes</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./gabby-hayes.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
