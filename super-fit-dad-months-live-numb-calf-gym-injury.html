with stage four cancer of the stomach and bone.</p><p>Stomach cancer is fairly uncommon in the UK and it's a cancer that can be found anywhere in the stomach.</p><p>Bone cancer is also rare and around 550 new cases of the illness are diagnosed each year.</p><p>The NHS can now only offer the family palliative care and Mark's wife Hannah, 45, along with their family and friends, is now <a href=#

cancer</h2><p>Mark said his lifestyle changed when he started to experience numbness in his calves, which he initially thought was the result of a pinched nerve due to his active lifestyle.</p><p>The numbness continued to spread and Mark visited his GP, who told him he may only have another 18 months to live.</p><p>Hannah said: "When they told us the diagnosis, I had a complete meltdown.</p><p>"He has tumours in his stomach that spread to his spine, which has caused the numbness.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Health News</h2></p><p>"When they told us, you obviously hope for the best so I thought it might have been stage two."</p><p>Hannah said that despite the diagnosis, the family are staying positive in the hope they can beat the illness.</p><p>Before becoming ill, Mark was working as a personal trainer and says he was 'almost in fighting shape'.</p><p>Mark said: "I used to box, I has 26 professional fights and I won 21 of them in my day.</p><p>"I also did MMA fighting and kick-boxing.</p><p>"In November I was almost in fighting shape, I could run six kilometres in 30 minutes.</p><p>"I was squatting 200 kilos for six reps regularly, and deadlifting 200 for 10 reps."</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">What are the symptoms of stomach and bone cancer you need to know</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>Mark was diagnosed with both stomach cancer and cancer of the bone.</p><p>Here are the symptoms you need to look out for when it comes to each condition.</p><p><strong>Stomach cancer</strong>:</p><ul><li>persistent&nbsp;indigestion&nbsp;and&nbsp;heartburn</li><li>trapped wind and frequent burping</li><li>feeling very full or bloated after meals</li><li>persistent&nbsp;stomach pain</li></ul><p><strong>Symptoms of bone cancer:</strong></p><ul><li>persistent bone pain that gets worse over time and continues into the night</li><li>swelling and redness (inflammation)&nbsp;over a bone, which can make movement difficult if&nbsp;the affected&nbsp;bone is near a joint</li><li>a noticeable lump over a bone</li><li>a weak bone that breaks (fractures) more easily than normal</li><li>problems moving around – for example, walking with a limp</li></ul><p>Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">NHS</a></p><p>Both Hannah and Mark are personal trainers so understand how it feels when you slightly overdo it with your workouts.</p><p>Hannah said: "When he said his calf was feeling really weird, I thought it must be a pinched nerve or something.</p><p>"He was regularly doing squats and deadlifts, so we just assumed it was down to that."</p><p>At present, Mark is receiving chemotherapy, which he is supplementing with alternative treatments.</p><p>Hannah said he has cut animal proteins out of his diet and that Mark is also not eating any sugar.</p><p>She added: "He said to me recently he was feeling the best he had done in months with the new diet."</p><p>In order to explore other treatment options, the family are now raising money.</p><p>So far they have managed to raise over £19,000.</p><h2
