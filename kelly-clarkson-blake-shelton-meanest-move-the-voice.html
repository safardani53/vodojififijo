Like, I love you."</p><p>She told D.Smooth that he had "the gift to make it all the way to the finale."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>Kelly explained her reasoning behind her use of the pass: "I had to use my Playoff Pass on D.Smooth because I just want him to advance.</p><p>"I want him to be in the playoffs and I want to see what he's going to do and he's hungry for it, y'all. He wants it."</p><p>Chance wasn't surprised that Kelly used her pass as he stated: "This is the second time I've tried to steal but I 100% knew in my bones that she was going to use her Playoff Pass then."</p><p>First-time judge <a href=#>Niall Horan</a> told Kelly that her move was "impressive."</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href=#>Blake</a> exclaimed that it was one of the "meanest things" he's ever seen on the singing competition show.</p><h2><strong>TENSION ON SET</strong></h2><p><a href=#>During a recent episode</a> of The Voice, Kelly got fed up with her show mentor Reba McEntire&nbsp;after she meddled in her personal life.</p><p>The "tension" that&nbsp;Kelly&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=#>Reba</a>, 68,&nbsp;have behind the scenes of&nbsp;The Voice&nbsp;started after the&nbsp;<a href=#>country music</a>&nbsp;legend inserted herself into Kelly's relationship with her ex-husband&nbsp;<a href=#>Brandon Blackstock</a>.</p><p>Reba apparently insisted that Kelly take back her ex-husband Brandon, 46, though they finalized their divorce in 2022.</p><p>Reba appears to be unable to "accept" that Kelly and Brandon, who is the star's stepson, are officially done, according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Radar Online</a>.</p><p>The country artist is pushing for the couple to mend their marriage out of wanting Kelly and Brandon to reconcile.</p><p>However, her persistence has begun to deteriorate her relationship with the talk show host.</p><p>"They have to play nice for the cameras, but things are really tense between them," a source explained to the publication.</p><p>"Reba's got it in her head that Kelly should take Brandon back, which has really upset Kelly."</p><p>While Reba may have well-meaning intentions, her interference is doing more harm than good.</p><p>Especially since an insider revealed that there was "no chance" that Kelly would get back with Brandon, thus making Reba's attempts futile.</p><p>A source told the news outlet that the Reba alum has a "delusional hope" that Kelly and Brandon will restore their relationship.</p><p>Reba believes that Kelly and Brandon's two kids, River, eight, and Remington, six, would fare "better" if their parents were reunited.</p><p>"Reba has this delusional hope Brandon and Kelly could work things out. She thinks it would be better for the kids," the insider divulged to Radar.</p><p>"Kelly's not having any of it. She thinks Reba should leave The Voice. The tension's boiling over —&nbsp;and everyone's worried it's going to come out on camera."</p><h2><strong>BLAKE'S FAREWELL</strong></h2><p>Meanwhile, back in October 2022,&nbsp;<a href=#>Blake</a> confirmed that season 23 of&nbsp;The Voice&nbsp;will be his last.</p><p>He&nbsp;is the last of the show's coaches to appear on every edition since the series premiered in 2011.</p><p><a href=#>In a statement</a>, Blake said: “I’ve been wrestling with this for a while and I’ve decided that it’s time for me to step away from&nbsp;The Voice&nbsp;after season 23.</p><p>“This show has changed my life in every way for the better, and it will always feel like home to me. </p><p>"It’s been a hell of a ride over these 12 years of chair turns, and I want to thank everyone at&nbsp;The Voice&nbsp;from NBC, every producer, the writers, musicians, crew and catering people, you are the best."</p><p>He continued: "It takes a lot of work, passion, and adult beverages (Ha!) to pull off a live show twice a week. </p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>“I’ve made lifelong bonds with Carson and every single one my fellow coaches over the years, including my wife, <a href=#>Gwen Stefani</a>..."</p><p>Blake and Gwen <a href=#>tied the knot</a> in July of 2021.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/04/blake-kelly-taken-without-permission-807852352.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/04/blake-kelly-taken-without-permission-807852385.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/04/kelly-clarkson-blake-shelton-photo-672686081.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hvZ26Fd32QaKKepJyueqS4wKuirKeeYq%2BtrcqeZKyglaHBsLqMppyappWowW65zq%2BcZqyYmnq3u8icnGg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fkelly-clarkson-blake-shelton-meanest-move-the-voice.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fkelly-clarkson-blake-shelton-meanest-move-the-voice.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fkelly-clarkson-blake-shelton-meanest-move-the-voice.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fkelly-clarkson-blake-shelton-meanest-move-the-voice.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fkelly-clarkson-blake-shelton-meanest-move-the-voice.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fkelly-clarkson-blake-shelton-meanest-move-the-voice.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./danny-tamberelli.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./danny-tamberelli.html>Danny Tamberelli</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./primark-christmas-grinch-ornament.html>Primark fans are obsessed with the new Grinch range, including a must-have decoration everyone is sc</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./primark-christmas-grinch-ornament.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
