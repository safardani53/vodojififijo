While pregnant with her, Alba <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>had a reaction</a> to baby detergent and was worried her child would endure the same issues. The mother-to-be wanted only the best for her new baby, including safe products that wouldn't irritate her delicate skin, and thus, she set out to start a company that made such products accessible to parents everywhere.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Alba has opened up about Honor's transition into her teen years and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>the challenges they've faced</a> as a mother-daughter duo trying to navigate this new period.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"They don't want you to even be right.

"Like my 13-year-old, I'm struggling with not treating her like a little [kid]— I want to treat them all like babies. I want to baby them," she told PEOPLE. "Still, my tendency is to parent them as if they are little. I started going to therapy with her I think when she was 11." Alba added that therapy has been beneficial for Honor as well and has helped her oldest child "find her voice."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Honor's 15th birthday</a>, Alba posted a sweet tribute to her first child on Instagram.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I am so proud of who you have become my Honorcita, you are everything and more my baby girl.

It was a nice little surprise."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Haven is currently on her way to middle school. In June 2022, the proud mom <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>shared a heartfelt message</a> for her daughter as she embarked on her new adventure. "Over the last 6 years, you have grown into such a kind, considerate leader that always checks in on those around you.

You are naturally intuitive and intelligent, but I love how much pride you put into your work," she wrote.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Jessica Alba Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Alba also continued the mother-daughter therapy tradition with her second daughter. In July 2022, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>the mom of three shared</a> that Haven was now attending therapy too, adding that it serves as a way for them to communicate with one another.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I went with both of them. And around puberty is when it's the time I think, for me, with my girls," she explained. "That's when they started to sort of shut down and get really like, 'I don't want to talk any more.' And I'm like, 'We're not doing this. We've got to keep a line of communication here. How can I be a better parent to you? How do you want me to talk to you? Don't shut me out.' "</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In addition to their therapy sessions, Alba and Haven spend plenty of quality time <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>goofing off</a> and getting busy in the kitchen. In October 2022, Alba <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>shared a sweet video</a> of her and Haven making homemade tortillas together like Alba used to do with her own grandmother as a child.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-hayes-alba-warren-6></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Hayes Alba W</strong>arren, 6</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Jessica Alba Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Alba and Warren <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>welcomed</a> their third child, son Hayes Alba Warren, on New Year's Eve in 2017. "Cash and I feel so blessed. Haven and Honor are already obsessed with their new baby bro," Alba wrote on Instagram to mark the occasion.
