Pisces, as the final sign, has absorbed every lesson taught by the preceding signs, including the pleasures and sorrows, hopes and anxieties. It is represented as two fish swimming in opposite directions, symbolizing Pisces' continual divide of attention between imagination and reality.</p><p>Cast member of the series Richie Rich in the role of Taj who later landed a series regular role in Netflix’s All About the Washingtons as Wesley Washington.
