Often formulated with ultra-nourishing oils, cuticle oils don’t just hydrate the cuticle and skin — they also promote healthy and strong nails, too.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Cuticle oil is essential in keeping your skin and your nail plate hydrated,” says Kristen Valdez-Dougherty, a San Francisco-based nail artist. Just like the complexion, hydrated nail beds have a more supple and healthy look. However, Valdez-Dougherty says it’s not all about looks as cuticle oil can also play an essential role in combatting uncomfortable side effects of dry skin on the hands and nails. “Hangnails are the first sign of dry skin, which could become painfully irritated, or even infected,” she explains. “Hydrated cuticles are your first line of defense to prevent that discomfort.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Whether you wear natural nails or go for enhancements like gels and acrylics, Elle Gerstein, a celebrity nail artist who has worked with Blake Lively, Mariah Carey, and Kelly Ripa, says cuticle oil is a key component of nail care, similar to applying serums and moisturizers to the skin. “It helps maintain the strength of the nail while delivering hydration which promotes flexibility,” she tells PEOPLE. “Your nails are like a sponge — when they’re dry, they crack,” Gerstein explains, noting that the best time to apply cuticle oil is after coming in contact with water, since it can help lock in moisture. Without flexibility, nails can become prone to breakage and might not bond as well with nail polish, gel, acrylic, or other nail enhancements and applications.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When it comes to cuticle oil, there’s just one problem: There are so many options to choose from.

The drugstore cuticle oil also has rose and jasmine extracts which work together to strengthen the nails and provide a deep conditioning effect that, with regular use, can reduce breakage and reverse signs of brittleness, which we found to be true, as our nails were very dry, brittle, and prone to peeling at the beginning of the testing period. In addition to these perks, we also noticed that the cuticle oil helped address some pesky dry skin and flaking around the nail beds, which improved the overall appearance of our manicure.&nbsp;A little bit goes a long way with this cuticle oil, which only adds to its already great value.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The only downside we found when testing this cuticle oil is that it took longer to absorb than other cuticle oils we tested — this one will take about five minutes to fully absorb, so keep that in mind if you're wanting to use it on the go.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>0.29 oz. | <strong>Star Ingredients: </strong>Jasmine extracts, rose extracts, vitamin E | <strong>Usage: </strong>Brush-on and rub in</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-runner-up-loccitane-shea-nail-and-cuticle-oil></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Overall, Runner Up</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>L'Occitane Shea Nail And Cuticle Oil</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="L'Occitane Shea Nail And Cuticle Oil" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/4jtrnNR5QjW8xHrLvryQE0mr-vw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/LOccitane-Shea-Nail-And-Cuticle-Oil-043c986f78274374a2ac411b70127334.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Application</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Appearance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Absorption</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Efficacy</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=3><li readability=0><p>Applicator brush makes applying the formula simple and effective and ensures you don’t waste any product</p></li><li readability=0><p>Fast-absorbing, so you don’t have to worry about having greasy fingers after applying</p></li><li readability=0><p>With regular use, we noticed a significant difference in our nail and cuticle health</p></li><li readability=0><p>Gentle enough for sensitive skin, including those with eczema</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you want a cuticle oil that is a little more on the luxe side of the spectrum, the L'Occitane Shea Nail And Cuticle Oil features a potent mix of oils, including shea oil, apricot oil, and sweet almond oil, which work together to target dehydrated and dry skin with an intense conditioning effect. When testing this product, we were immediately obsessed with the applicator brush, which made applying the formula to our nail beds super easy and made it possible to not waste any product (which we appreciated, considering this isn’t the cheapest cuticle oil on our list). We also loved how the formula felt on our skin and found that it has a very gentle ingredient makeup, which is safe enough for sensitive skin including eczema.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>0.25 oz. | <strong>Star Ingredients: </strong>Shea oil, apricot oil, sweet almond oil | <strong>Usage: </strong>Brush-on</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-sally-hansen-vitamin-e-nail--cuticle-oil></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Budget</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Sally Hansen Vitamin E Nail & Cuticle Oil</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Sally Hansen Vitamin E Nail &amp;amp; Cuticle Oil" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/b8eEjZ2XxV_5Zxq75K1NvWF5Bb8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/sally-hansen-vitamin-e-nail-and-cuticle-oil-308126df72be4e74859190710ab5d72d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Application</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Appearance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Absorption</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.7</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Efficacy</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=3.5><li readability=0><p>We could easily control the amount of product by wiping off some of the brush on the sides of the bottle</p></li><li readability=2><p>Helps promote strong and healthy nails and, with regular use, we noticed our nails weren’t as brittle</p></li><li readability=2><p>Formulated with apricot kernel, aloe, and vitamin E, the cuticle oil is ultra-hydrating</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When it comes to the best cuticle oil, the Sally Hansen Vitamin E Nail & Cuticle Oil takes the cake. This cheap drugstore formula is comparable to its luxe counterparts, thanks to its deeply nourishing formula that includes vitamin E, apricot kernel, and aloe. Upon first testing this product, we were thrilled to find out that you actually have a lot of control with the application, since it comes in a nail polish-like bottle where you can easily wipe some of the cuticle oil on the sides of the bottle to get the perfect amount. And, with regular use, we noticed that our nails and cuticles weren’t just hydrated, but the brittleness we once experienced was basically all gone by the end of the testing period. While it’s worth mentioning that it takes a little bit of time to absorb, the amount of time felt relatively normal for cuticle oil, so it’s definitely not a dealbreaker.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>0.45 oz. | <strong>Star Ingredients: </strong>Vitamin E, apricot kernel, aloe | <strong>Usage: </strong>Brush-on and massage</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-hydrating-cuccio-milk-and-honey-revitalizing-cuticle-oil></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Hydrating</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Cuccio Milk and Honey Revitalizing Cuticle Oil</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Cuccio Milk and Honey Revitalizing Cuticle Oil" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/d4e1fYlQIqCvL89zzql_jS2lcNg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Cuccio-Milk-and-Honey-Revitalizing-Cuticle-Oil-146bb4edf11043eebd327b1bc819e766.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Application</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Appearance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Absorption</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Efficacy</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=0><p>Ultra-nourishing formula, even on thick and stubborn cuticles</p></li><li readability=0><p>Amazing texture that feels more like a dry oil versus wet, so it doesn’t make a mess</p></li><li><p>Dries super quickly</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While all of the cuticle oils on our list are hydrating, the Cuccio Milk and Honey Revitalizing Oil from Amazon is our top pick because it is formulated with a blend of nourishing ingredients — including vitamin E and sunflower oil — that are powerful enough to treat thick, stubborn, and dehydrated cuticles. In addition to providing effective hydration, we also love the texture because, despite having oils in the formula, it has more of a dry finish versus a wet one, so you don’t have to worry too much about it making a mess.&nbsp;We did notice that it comes out of the dropper rather quickly, which took some getting used to, but once we did we appreciated the efficiency.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>2.5, 0.5, and 8 oz. | <strong>Star Ingredients: </strong>Vitamin E, sunflower oil | <strong>Usage: </strong>Drop onto nail beds and massage</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-oil-opi-prospa-nail--cuticle-oil></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Oil</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>OPI ProSpa Nail & Cuticle Oil</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="OPI ProSpa Nail &amp;amp; Cuticle Oil" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/SvU1NClJR6kCFIO1D_bE3oDMuOI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/OPI-ProSpa-Nail-and-Cuticle-Oil-0e33d410d8dc4024b2cc2410593e95dc.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Application</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Appearance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Absorption</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Efficacy</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1><li readability=0><p>With grape seed oil in its formula, this cuticle oil can reverse brittleness and strengthen nails</p></li><li readability=0><p>Despite being enriched with a collection of oils, it has a lightweight formula</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Dropper applicator makes it easy to get an accurate application</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For an oil that targets both the nails and the nail bed with a rich concoction of oils, we love the OPI Nail and Cuticle Oil. Formulated with grape seed, sesame, kukui, sunflower, and cupuaçu oils, this deep-conditioning cuticle oil can actually reverse signs of brittleness and also strengthen nails, in addition to protecting against dehydration. After testing out this OPI cuticle oil, we found that it worked effectively at hydrating our nails but also noticed a significant change in the overall health of our nail beds and how strong our nails felt after regular use. With all of the oil in the formula, we found that it doesn’t absorb as well as some other options on our list, however, that is to be expected with a rich formula like this.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>0.29, 0.5, and 0.95 oz. | <strong>Star Ingredients: </strong>Grape seed, sesame, kukui, sunflower, and cupuaçu oils | <strong>Usage: </strong>Drop onto nail beds and massage</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>People / Elise Wojczyk Wang</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-nail-growth-olive--june-cuticle-serum-duo></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Nail Growth</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Olive & June Cuticle Serum Duo</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Olive &amp;amp; June Cuticle Serum Duo" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/URUC9SFZAnNvY6e7iut44QsT8TQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/olive--june-cuticle-serum-duo-0da2fa1dcb594e84b1958951abbd56a4.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Olive & June</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Application</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Appearance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Absorption</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.7</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Efficacy</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.7</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=3><li readability=-1><p>Formulated with a powerful mix of botanical oils that deeply hydrate and soothe chapped cuticles</p></li><li readability=0><p>With the inclusion of jojoba oil, it promotes nail growth (and we experienced results!)</p></li><li readability=1><p>Cuticle oil absorbs in under 30 seconds, so it’s a lot more quick-drying compared to other formulas</p></li><li readability=0><p>Promotes nail growth, especially after nail extensions</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When testing the Olive & June Cuticle Serum Duo, we removed our nail extensions to get the full experience (and in hopes of it effectively reviving our damage-prone nail beds). Formulated with a blend of botanical oils — including avocado, apricot kernel, jojoba seed, and sunflower seed oil — this nail care product is not only hydrating but is jam-packed with tons of nutrients that soothe, protect, and revive the nails. Upon testing this product out, we were most impressed by how well it strengthened our nail beds and, over time, resulted in some noticeable growth. Also, we loved how easy the applicator brush was to use, though we didn’t love the twist-up design as it took a little while for the oil to come to the surface.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Star Ingredients:</strong> Avocado, apricot kernel, jojoba seed, and sunflower seed oil | <strong>Usage: </strong>Twist the pen, then dab onto cuticles and massage</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-7 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=1305 data-sizes=750px alt="Olive & June Cuticle Serum Duo" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/H0gcUY1_EItsrXqBxDoL3hI7g9w=/fit-in/1500x1305/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/peo-cuticle-oils-test-olive-june-serum-duo-elise-wang-01-d4763db71fc346cab0031beb5a452ba3.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>People / Elise Wojczyk Wang</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=1318 data-sizes=750px alt="Olive & June Cuticle Serum Duo" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/QIH5jPTJasSMJb-etx-xLEQyYsY=/fit-in/1500x1318/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/peo-cuticle-oils-test-olive-june-serum-duo-elise-wang-02-763460fc06a94846bc7d3bc93ab36d43.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>People / Elise Wojczyk Wang</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-strengthening-deborah-lippmann-its-a-miracle-intense-therapy-cuticle-oil-pen></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Strengthening</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Deborah Lippmann It's A Miracle Pen</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Deborah Lippmann It's A Miracle Intense Therapy Cuticle Oil" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/zkyDySDb-RykXJMGA4_cNMEvg3o=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Deborah-Lippmann-Its-A-Miracle-Intense-Therapy-Cuticle-Oil-327ad69cb57b416c8f453eaac6171999.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Application</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Appearance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.7</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Absorption</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.7</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Efficacy</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.7</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>Blend of shea butter and vitamin E help prevent the splitting of the nails</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Applicator brush is ultra-precise and helps prevent a potential mess</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Soothes flaky and dehydrated cuticles</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our top pick for the best strengthening cuticle oil is the Deborah Lippmann It’s a Miracle Pen, which is formulated with a blend of shea butter and vitamin E to prevent the splitting of nails. While testing this nail product, we found that the formula lived up to its expectation and, after just a few weeks, our nails were noticeably stronger and more sturdy. The application process was also super easy since the built-in brush (which sort of resembles a twist-up lip gloss) helps with precision and prevents the oil from going everywhere. And, in addition to stronger nails, we also saw that the cuticles and skin around our nail beds were much less dry and dehydrated, and by the end of the testing period, the flakiness we often experienced went away, too.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>1.2, 2, and 12 oz. | <strong>Star Ingredients: </strong>Shea butter, vitamin E | <strong>Usage: </strong>Twist pen and dab onto cuticles; brush onto cuticles and massage</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Rachel Lee</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-with-essential-oil-tenoverten-the-rose-oil-nourishing-cuticle-oil></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best with Essential Oil</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Tenoverten The Rose Oil Cuticle Oil</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Tenoverten The Rose Oil Nourishing Cuticle Oil" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/mQ-y2GGoB8TGSh4vw3-dMpzJ8Eo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/tenoverten-the-rose-oil-nourishing-cuticle-oil-99cd20f19067420495c01928842a8beb.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Target</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Application</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.7</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Appearance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.7</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Absorption</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Efficacy</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.7</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=2.5><li readability=2><p>Formula is enriched with a potent collection of botanical oils that nourish, protect, and heal the skin around the nails</p></li><li readability=0><p>With its inclusion of jojoba oil, this cuticle oil promotes nail growth</p></li><li readability=0><p>With regular use, nails look and feel healthier and more nourished</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When it comes to cuticle oils, nail experts agree that essential oil is, well, essential to providing nourishment and promoting long and strong nails.

From there, we conducted an overnight test to see if the cuticle oils’ effects were long-lasting. We repeated this every day for two weeks before compiling all of our findings together, examining the data, and handpicking each cuticle oil on this list that met the product expectations (and, in some cases, exceeded). We rated each cuticle oil on a 1 to 5 scale based on each testing attribute — the formulas with the highest ratings overall earned a spot on this list of the best cuticle oils.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-faq-6c64373d-995f-4b97-8a5b-be85eaba08ec></span><p>Frequently Asked Questions</p><ul id=mntl-sc-block-faq__content_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-faq__content mntl-accordion" readability=43.74492282697><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-0.80334316617502><p><span class=accordion__title>What is the best oil to use on your cuticles?</span></p><p>After testing dozens of formulas, we found that the best cuticle oil overall is the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Sally Hansen Treatment Cuticle Rehab</a>, which helps promote strong and healthy nails with apricot kernel, aloe, and vitamin E.

She explains that cuticle oil not only works but regular application can result in barely needing cuticle maintenance when getting a manicure. In addition to nourishment, cuticle oil can actually promote better adhesion to nail products, which is highly beneficial. “My clients who don’t moisturize, [have nails that] tend to pull away from the product I’ve applied, which means bacteria can get trapped between the nail and the enhancement.”</p></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-trust-people></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Trust PEOPLE?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Jessie Quinn</a> is a contributing commerce writer for PEOPLE and has written for publications such as Byrdie, InStyle, The Spruce, NYLON, and more.
