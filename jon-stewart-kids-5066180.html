Although not much is publicly known about the teen, his mom frequently posts about him on her social media, especially when he was a pre-teen. In May 2016, Nathan posed next to an adorable cow on his mom’s Instagram. “Nate and I just got back from spending time with some of our dearest friends up at @farmsanctuary,” she captioned the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>sweet post</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/jon-stewart-kids-embed3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>When Nate was born, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>his dad</a> was in his 40s and about five years into hosting his hit show&nbsp;The Daily Show. Later, in Sept. 2016, Jon’s only son was <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pictured</a> feeding a baby sheep on his mom’s veterinary account. “Round the clock bottle-feeding made it a necessity to include other caregivers, and fortunately there was no shortage of family members that wanted to pitch in. #TBT #dountoanimals #rescuesheep #elizasheep #farmsanctuary,” the momma bear captioned the endearing snapshot.</p><h2>Maggie Rose Stewart</h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>Two years after Jon and his wife welcomed Nate, they revealed they had <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>welcomed a daughter</a>, Maggie Rose Stewart, in 2006. At the time, a 42-year-old Jon told&nbsp;<strong>David Letterman&nbsp;</strong>about his excitement and nerves about raising a girl, as reported by&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE</a>. “I don’t know that much about women,” the father-of-two said at the time. “A boy child, I feel like I’ll know how to deal with it if he has a problem. I’ll just be able to say to him, ‘Well, repress it,’ and he will hopefully swallow that, as I have. And then you figure you have 30 years before it comes out over dinner where somebody spills the gravy and then you’re like ‘I hate you!’” He continued, “A girl, she’s going to want me to have tea with her and her panda. Like, what am I going to do with that?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/jon-stewart-kids-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-10>And just like her older brother, Maggie is often spotted on her mom’s Instagram as well. “My daughter and husband spent the day traveling around with @minihorseheroes – a foundation in memory of Police Officer Ken Tietjen – bringing smiles to NY police officers and firemen. Hamlet and Honor on board!”, Tracey captioned the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>photos</a> of her little one with a horse in Sept. 2016. Another cute photo his wife shared was of Maggie and her pops later that month. “These two spread a lot of nice on a day when it was really needed,” she captioned <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the photo</a> of her daughter with Jon.</p><h2>What Jon Has Said About Parenthood</h2><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Jon has done a few interviews here and there about being a father and raising two kids. In 2015, he appeared on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>CBS Sunday Morning</a>&nbsp;and revealed that raising his kids was similar to managing the late singer&nbsp;<strong>Chuck Berry</strong>. “I think having kids impacts your life in a day-to-day way that’s different than your political ideology or leaning,” he said at the time. “It’s much more about like running a small business where you’re trying to keep elves alive.” He also called it a “logistical nightmare” before adding that, “It’s more like what is must’ve been like to be Chuck Berry’s manager.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>Most recently, he made a joke about his children’s academic futures in a 2019 interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>US Weekly</a>. “Well, I’m already learning Photoshop so that I can figure out how to get them into a variety of sports and debates and things,” he joked, seemingly in reference to the major college <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>admissions scandal</a> at the time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8mopWarpJrEor7TZqKinKNignGClWpvaWc%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjon-stewart-kids-5066180.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjon-stewart-kids-5066180.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjon-stewart-kids-5066180.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjon-stewart-kids-5066180.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjon-stewart-kids-5066180.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjon-stewart-kids-5066180.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./nikki-bella-ex-john-cenas-quotes-about-each-other-after-split.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./nikki-bella-ex-john-cenas-quotes-about-each-other-after-split.html>Nikki Bella, Ex John Cena's Quotes About Each Other After Split</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./jordan-love.html>Jordan Love Bio: NFL &amp;amp; Net Worth [2023 Update]</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./jordan-love.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
