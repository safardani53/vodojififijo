Lewis was hailed as “possibly the last real, great symbol of the beginning of Rock N Roll” by his agency, which verified his death. Lewis died of natural causes at his home in Desoto County, Mississippi, south of Memphis, according to sources.</p><p>According to Jerry Lee Lewis’ spokesman, Zach Farnum, his seventh wife, Judith, was at his side when he died. According to Farnum, Lewis informed his wife that in his closing days, he embraced the hereafter and was not terrified. The vocalist of Great Balls of Fire has been compared to genre giants like as Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Carl Perkins, Fats Domino, and Buddy Holly, among others.</p><p>Jerry Lee Lewis’ spokesman, Zach Farnum, stated in a statement:</p><p>“He was there at the start (sic) and saw them slip away one by one until it was only him bearing witness and singing of the birth of rock’n’roll.”</p><p>The late artist’s seventh wife, Judith, sent the following statement to AFP:</p><p>“He is prepared to go. He had mistreated his body so badly as a young man that he was given little hope of surviving middle life, much alone old age.”</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>“Goodbye to the Killer” RIP<br>Keith<br>From the 1983 Salute to Jerry Lee Lewis <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">@jerryleelewis</a> <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/SRAkPPH8qR</a></p><p>— Keith Richards (@officialKeef) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">October 28, 2022</a></p><h2>Jerry Lee Lewis was dubbed “The Killer” In the 1950s</h2><p>Jerry Lee Lewis’s performing style and theatrics earned him the moniker “The Killer” by the late 1950s. Lewis was well-known for his unabashed piano-playing style, which included pounding the keys with his fists and elbows, stomping his piano bench, climbing atop his instrument, and even lighting it on fire. Elton John and other musicians affected him greatly.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Jerry-Lee-Lewis.jpg alt="Jerry Lee Lewis" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Lewis said in Rick Bragg’s 2014 book Jerry Lee Lewis: His Own Story:</p><p>“I was born to perform on stage.” I couldn’t wait to be a part of it. I had a dream about it. And I’ve been on one my whole life. That’s where I’m most content.”</p><p>He also discussed his scandalous and violent lifestyle, stating:</p><p>“I’m no goody, and I’m no fake.” I never claimed to be anything, and everything I did was as open as a case knife. I lived my life to the fullest and had a great time doing it.”</p><h2>Jerry Lee Lewis was a studio musician for performers like Carl Perkins and Johnny Cash.</h2><p>Lewis was born into a farming family in Ferriday, Louisiana in 1935. He began playing the piano at the age of nine and dropped out of school to pursue his musical career. In 1956, he flew to Memphis to serve as a session musician for emerging performers like as Carl Perkins and Johnny Cash at Sun Studios.</p><p>He also assisted Elvis Presley. Lewis recorded a session with Presley, Perkins, and Cash in 1956, which became known as the “Million Dollar Quartet.” The next year, the musician rose to prominence with his breakthrough single, Whole Lotta Shakin’ Goin’ On. The song’s aggressive lyrics upset several radio stations, who first refused to play it.</p><p>Lewis told The New York Times in 2006:</p><p>“To me, it was simply another song.” The girls got a bit crazy, but that’s what females are like.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Jerry-Lee-Lewis-1.jpg alt="Jerry Lee Lewis" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Jerry Lee Lewis was notorious for his scandals, which included marrying his 13-year-old cousin when he was 22 in 1957, thus ending his career. Lewis inadvertently shot his bass player Norman “Butch” Owens in the chest in 1976. He was allegedly attempting to strike a coke bottle.</p><p>In 1986, the musician was inducted into the inaugural class of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Jerry Lewis was awarded with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1989 for his contributions to the music industry. That same year, he recorded a song for the film Great Balls of Fire!, which rekindled his career. His most recent release was a gospel album with his cousin Jimmy Swaggart.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGihnqqirnqtscRmo56vmah6sa3SrJydZZGsrrp5wK1kraCVYq6osYyonWZwZ2Q%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjerry-lee-lewis-passed-away-at-the-age-of-87.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjerry-lee-lewis-passed-away-at-the-age-of-87.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjerry-lee-lewis-passed-away-at-the-age-of-87.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjerry-lee-lewis-passed-away-at-the-age-of-87.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjerry-lee-lewis-passed-away-at-the-age-of-87.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjerry-lee-lewis-passed-away-at-the-age-of-87.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./nessa-barrett-ex-boyfriend-josh-richards-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./nessa-barrett-ex-boyfriend-josh-richards-html.html>Nessa Barrett Breaks Down Her EP: Does She Forgive Ex Boyfriend Josh Richards?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./tyler-florence-married.html>Is Tyler Florence Married?
