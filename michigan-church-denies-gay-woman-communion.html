It created who I am,” she told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>MLive.com</a>. “We were taught ‘love everyone.’”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On Nov. 17, she received communion from Rev. Scott Nolan just as she always has — but six days later, Nolan called her on the phone.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“[He said], ‘It was good to see you in church on Sunday. Because you and Linda are married in the state of Michigan, I’d like you to respect the church and not come to communion,’” Smolenski told CNN.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Smolenski, 62, married Linda Burpee, her partner of nearly 30 years, in March 2016, a union that was made public because she is an elected official, the outlet reported.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“In 62 years, this is the first time I’ve ever been denied,” she told MLive.com. “Why now? And why me?”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>WoodTV 8</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Nolan, who has been at St. Stephen for about three years, defended his decision in an interview with NBC affiliate <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>WOOD</a>, saying he was simply following the teachings of popes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“To me, this is also a cause of great sadness in my own life as a priest,” he said. “Some of that criteria are just around what’s happening in that person’s life, and what do they believe, and what are they doing, and what are they not doing.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Still, for Smolenski, Nolan’s actions felt personal, as she says “good and decent [and] wonderful priests” elsewhere know her and have still given her communion.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I try to be a good and faithful servant to our lord Jesus Christ,” she told WOOD. “My faith is a huge part of who I am, but it is the church that made that faith, the very church where he is now taking a stance and saying, ‘Ho-ho, not you.'”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Nolan, 33, responded by saying he is not “responsible” for what other priests do or don’t do.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“It might look like it is discriminatory or particular or specific or targeted, but I disagree,” he said. “Bishop, who is, we believe, the principal of unity of the Catholic church here in west Michigan, has been supportive of me.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Diocese of Grand Rapids issued a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>statement</a> backing Nolan shortly after the incident made headlines, and included a quote from Pope Francis’ Amoris Laetitia about creating divisions among church members.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“We appreciated Judge Sara Smolenski’s service to the community. We are grateful for her past generosity. These facts are not at issue in this matter,” the statement read.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Inclusion and acceptance have been a hallmark of Catholic Churches in the Diocese of Grand Rapids throughout the diocese’s history,” the statement continued. “They remain so. They presume, however, a respect on the part of individuals for the teachings and practice of the wider Catholic community. No community of faith can sustain the public contradiction of its beliefs by its own members. This is especially so on matters as central to Catholic life as marriage, which the Church has always held, and continues to hold, as a sacred covenant between one man and one woman.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The statement also noted that Nolan approached Smolenski in private, and that the diocese supported the “appropriateness of his action.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For her part, Smolenski told CNN that the Catholic church should embrace Pope Francis’ push for people to be loving and kind, and that it had bigger problems to “tackle” than sexual orientation.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She also said she has been “distancing” herself from the church for some time, especially after Nolan allegedly denied communion to a same-sex couple earlier in the year.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“This is not about me against the priest, and it’s not really me against the church. This feels like selective discrimination. Why choose gay people, and why now?” she said. “I am who I am because God made me just like this.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5iquqK6jKKlrZ2imsC1e8yimqGhl5a7bq%2FHrqmcoF2Zsq%2B1xKxkoJmpYsSwucCnZJynnaLCr7XOp2Y%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmichigan-church-denies-gay-woman-communion.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmichigan-church-denies-gay-woman-communion.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmichigan-church-denies-gay-woman-communion.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmichigan-church-denies-gay-woman-communion.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmichigan-church-denies-gay-woman-communion.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmichigan-church-denies-gay-woman-communion.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./tracey-edmonds-19670218-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./tracey-edmonds-19670218-html.html>Tracey Edmonds (Entrepreneur) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./kim-kardashian-bob-hair-makeover-anna-wintour-photos.html>Kim Kardashians Bob Hair Makeover With Anna Wintour: Photos Hollywood Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./kim-kardashian-bob-hair-makeover-anna-wintour-photos.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
