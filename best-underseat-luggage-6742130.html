While most airlines require around 16 x 14 x 9 inches for an item stowed under the seat, it can be tough to know which bag will a. fit the airline's requirements and b. have all the elements you need. That's why we went to work in our PEOPLE Tested Lab to simulate packing 19 different bags for a 2-day trip, maneuvering them around an obstacle course, and stowing it in our staged "underseat" area to see how well they fit. We then took these bags home and tested them for up to six months while traveling and commuting to see how well they work in the real world.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When shopping for a great underseat luggage bag, professional organizer Eryn Donaldson of The Model Home, says she accounts for the other luggage she might have with her. “I look for something that has a trolley sleeve so that I can hook it onto my rolling bag,” she tells PEOPLE. “A shoulder strap is also a nice touch — basically, I like to keep my hands free to carry my phone or anything else.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">And organization is key when it comes to going through the airport motions. “It’s so much easier going through security when everything has its specific compartments and you can quickly pull out electronics without digging through the bottom of your bag,” she adds.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Keep reading for the underseat luggage pieces that ultimately came out on top.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-calpak-hue-mini-carry-on-luggage></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Overall</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Calpak Mini Carry-on Luggage</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Calpak Hue Mini Carry-On Luggage" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/R-DwsPC_DJrnb0Eb16IzTDA5b0g=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/CalpakHueMiniCarry-OnLuggage-a0160be8dcb143d0afcac52d03a549b9.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Calpak</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Capacity</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Maneuverability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Functionality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1><li readability=0><p>This small luggage features a sleek, hard-sided shell for a minimalist look</p></li><li readability=0><p>It’s a rolling suitcase, and the wheels have seamless maneuverability</p></li><li readability=-1><p>There are several pockets and compartments for superior organization</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For short trips, this mini carry-on has just about everything you might need. We were able to easily fit two pairs of pants, a bomber jacket, flip-flops, three shirts, and a laptop sleeve inside — not bad for a piece of luggage this size.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The design impressed us just as much as the capacity. Not only did the exterior look professional, &nbsp;minimalist, and tidy without looking too stuffy or conservative, but it also came with a built-in dial lock, which makes us feel like our things are that much safer. The only design downside, though, was the lack of outer pockets, so small items aren’t easily accessible in-flight. Inside, the main compartment is clamshell-style, with one side featuring a zip-around compartment, plus a mesh zip pocket and two sleeves. The other side has two small zip pockets.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As for comfort with the suitcase at your feet, we thought that it fit easily in an underseat compartment, and while it is hard-sided, there’s a bit of give, should you need to wedge the bag into a tight spot. It was also a breeze to maneuver the Calpak Hue thanks to its four spinner wheels, which felt smooth and sturdy during our testing.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Overall, we found the Calpak Hue Mini Carry-on Luggage to be a great value given its performance and bonus extras like well-designed pockets and a built-in look. This is a functional and sleek bag that would be great to have for quick trips.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it’s held up:</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Through virtually all modes of transportation, this Calpak piece has been a dream throughout all of our travels. It fits snugly in the underseat compartments on everything from plane seats to train cars, and it even did well for us on our camping trips (we liked that the hard shell kept our clothes extra protected and dry). We’ve continuously been surprised by how much it can store despite its small size, though its compact frame is perfect for storing away once we get home from our travels. We wish there were outer pockets for easy security line access, but we’re also not mad because we love its sleek, uniform exterior. For many of our testers, this roller has been their steadfast travel buddy for the past few months, and they don’t see that changing anytime soon.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 16 x 14 x 8 in. | <strong>Weight:</strong> 6.4 lbs. | <strong>Materials</strong>: Polycarbonate, polyester | <strong>Packing Capacity</strong>:<strong> </strong>28 L</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-nicole-miller-underseat-luggage></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Budget</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Nicole Miller Underseat Luggage</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Nicole Miller Underseat Luggage" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/uZpt8s5ro3GNsR57p4UIYWU9Dqg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/nicole-miller-underseat-luggage-46f974e7ab0345588eaca84566a12aa9.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Capacity</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Maneuverability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Functionality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>This bag is spacious while still fitting perfectly underneath a plane seat</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It has a chic look that resembles a large purse rather than a rolling luggage</p></li><li readability=-1><p>The wheels rotate and take corners with ease</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There’s no denying how cute this purse-like rolling bag is, but what’s even more attractive is its comparatively lower price. Complete with a luggage strap, an extendable handle, and easily maneuverable wheels, this gold-accented bag was a hit while we traveled. Its design is fairly simple, consisting of a top zipper that opens up the bag into what is essentially one large pocket. It doesn’t offer much in terms of organization, but if you’re someone who’s looking to just throw some items in and go, then we don’t think this will be too much of a deterrent.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We do wish that it came with a padded sleeve to protect our laptops since this would be the perfect budget-friendly bag for a work trip, but because there’s no designated place for our computers, we’re hesitant to gravitate towards this one for business-oriented travels (unless we stash them in between layers of clothes for some cushion). However, with its roomy storage, excellent wheels, and even better price, we’re loving this rolling bag as a more affordable option for non-work adventures.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it’s held up:</strong>&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Whether it’s on a plane or a train, this bag seems to fit snugly under whichever seat we’re stowing it under. Despite months of use, we’re not seeing any wear and tear on the interior or exterior, which makes us think it will continue to last for quite a while. Despite its lower price, we do think the bag still has a stylish quality that looks professional and can be easily used for work trips (if you’re okay with the lack of a computer sleeve). It fits under airline seats and fits the basic clothes we need — and for that, we can’t complain.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 15 x 9 x 14 in. | <strong>Weight:</strong> 4 lbs. | <strong>Materials</strong>: Nylon | <strong>Packing Capacity</strong>:<strong> </strong>Not specified</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-investment-tumi-voyageur-oxford-compact-carry-on></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Investment</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Tumi Voyageur Oxford Compact Carry-on</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1230 data-sizes=750px alt="Tumi Voyageur Oxford Compact Carry-On" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/N0av16_tzqioZVg2OH1KR2Sm7_8=/fit-in/1500x1230/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/TumiVoyageurOxfordCompactCarry-On-c0b985a562d24b0292a7c1ea4c7f9505.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Bloomingdale's</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Capacity</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Maneuverability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Functionality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1.5><li readability=-1><p>There are a ton of extra features that you wouldn’t get with less-expensive options</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It has decent packing capacity and easy-to-reach outside pockets</p></li><li readability=0><p>The wheels moved flawlessly, navigating twists and turns with ease</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It looks more upscale than the rest of the bags we tested</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When it comes to luxury luggage (that’s not designer), Tumi is one of the best to do it — and their Compact Carry-On was no exception. Complete with a split-layer zipper compartment for maximum organization (think clothes and shoes on one side, toiletries on the other), you can fit a lot more than meets the eye in this square suitcase. There’s also a protective sleeve that can fit a laptop up to 14 inches wide, making this a surefire solution for your business trip packing problems. We also loved how easy it was to maneuver this bag, as its four recessed wheels allowed us to glide around corners with no trouble at all, a trait that will come in handy next time you’re late for your connecting flight.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">But because of all of its compartments and pockets, though very helpful, this bag has the capability to get overstuffed and not fit under the seat. We found that if we flip it on its face (so the flat back is facing the sky), it can slide easier underneath the seat. But because of this, we worry about the fabric scuffing after several times of storing it this way. However, we can’t deny the many perks and exquisite style that come with this costlier pick — from its several handles to its attached bag tag and built-in USB port, there’s so much to love about this Tumi roller bag. If you’re looking for an option to splurge on (and get several years out of), then this is the one.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it’s held up:</strong>&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To our relief, we have not experienced any scuff marks or damage (yet) in the months that we’ve been trying out this suitcase. We’re loving how sleek the design is and how lightweight it feels, despite the amount of clothes that we’ve stuffed into it for the weekend. While we know this is an expensive pick, we do think it’s worth the splurge if you want to invest in something that will last you for years. Rather than grabbing something cheaper and needing to replace it later, this could be a great investment that could save you money in the long run.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 16 x 14 x 8 in. | <strong>Weight:</strong> 6.6 lbs. | <strong>Materials</strong>: Nylon | <strong>Packing Capacity</strong>:<strong> </strong>21 L</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-features-samsonite-spinner-underseater-with-usb-port></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Features</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Samsonite Spinner Underseater</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Samsonite Underseat Carry-On Spinner with USB Port, Ocean" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/HuRhMpmObXgTk61SFjVxdE4EZJc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/samsonite-underseat-carry-on-spinner-with-usb-port-ocean-57fb9869b0cb48a7a3e7fe5c218dfab4.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Capacity</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Maneuverability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Functionality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=0><p>The luggage is well-made, touting quality wheels and nice exterior pockets for easy access</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It comes with an external USB port&nbsp;to charge your gadget</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Functionality is the name of the game with the Samsonite Spinner Underseater with USB port. This bag was able to fit all of our two-day trip belongings, with exterior pockets to store items for quick access while on a plane. Our tested did note that there was a lack of ties/straps to compress clothing in the suitcase, which would be a nice touch if you wanted to fit more items inside.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There are several pockets and a separator inside for organization, and the USB port is a great feature. The size is good overall, though it was a little snug in our testing to fit this model under a seat. Testing out the bag in our obstacle course, it was extremely smooth to maneuver; the handle and extended handle make it easy to transition between different types of flooring, escalators, or stairs.</p><p>We found the price to be decent for this bag, and a good option to have for short trips when you don’t need a large bag. It’s a great-looking, functional bag that is sleek to maneuver. A good buy for functionality, overall.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it’s held up:</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Even after a few months, we’re still loving all the nifty pockets, organizational compartments, and extra features (like the USB port) that come with this luggage. We’ve found that the wheels maneuver effortlessly and its compact frame fits into most spaces easily (and we especially love how space-saving it is in the car). It’s a total savior on weekend trips because it eliminates the need to carry a heavy duffel on your shoulder and fits just about everything you’d need for a two-day trip. However, this may be best for your summer travels, because we thought it was a little hard to stuff sweaters into this spinner during the cooler months. Still, we’re loving this one for its helpful functionality and features.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions:</strong> Exterior: 16.5 x 13.75 x 9 in. | <strong>Linear dimensions: </strong>39.2 in. | <strong>Weight:</strong> 5.6 lbs. | <strong>Material</strong>:<strong> </strong>Polyester | <strong>Packing Capacity</strong>:<strong> </strong>36 L</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-toiletries-steve-madden-underseat-wheeled-bag></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Toiletries</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Steve Madden Underseat Wheeled Bag</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Steve Madden Underseat Wheeled Bag" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/BksUyMF1FYpXg6YNI6Vmt6ZlhdQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/steve-madden-underseat-wheeled-bag-015d94e5c8fa4488a23d94cec18e147a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Capacity</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Maneuverability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Functionality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1.5><li readability=0><p>Both the interior and exterior are packed with handy, high-quality compartments</p></li><li readability=0><p>Touting two easily maneuverable wheels, it’s very easy to transport this rolling luggage</p></li><li readability=0><p>Just like the designer’s shoes, this bag is attractive and stylish</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You’ve got compartments galore with the Steve Madden Underseat Wheeled Bag, making it our top choice for toiletries. We really loved the amount of toiletry-friendly compartments within the bag, which perfectly fit all the small things we travel with. It also contains a clear, zippable compartment, which made it easier than ever to find our items inside.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The aesthetics are a big draw, too. Its vintage look elevates your average luggage with its brown and gold accents and allows your bag to stand out in style among the sea of drab baggage (though we’d expect nothing less from Steve Madden).&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Despite the compartments that keep everything tucked away and organized, fitting the bag under a seat was a struggle. However, we did have a bit of trouble when it came to fitting our bags under our seats due to the decorative zipper tassels. This may be because we filled this bag to the very top, so if you’re planning a lot of outfit changes, this may not be the one for you. But when we flipped the luggage face down, it fit under the space with greater ease.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">All in all, the bag moved effortlessly and still felt light despite being packed full. We did think the price was slightly high given the size and space, but we think it reflects the stylish look of its exterior (and the convenience of its organized interior). We wouldn’t hesitate to recommend the bag for those traveling on a short summer trip (bulky clothes would be problematic), and for those who value the look of their luggage.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it’s held up:</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Even after months of testing, this bag has yet to show a speck of wear and tear (which we can’t say about any of our previously-owned luggage). Despite frequent use, we haven’t noticed a decline in the performance of the zippers or rips in any of the pockets, which is a major win in our book. It’s proven to be perfect for weekend stays, typically fitting up to two nights’ worth of clothing, and it’s not a hassle to slide under plane and train seats. Plus, it stows perfectly in a car. Compact and cute? We're in.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 15 x 14 x 9 in. | <strong>Weight:</strong> 4.84 lbs. | <strong>Material</strong>: Polyester | <strong>Packing Capacity</strong>:<strong> </strong>5 L</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-rolling-kenneth-cole-reaction-chelsea-luggage-expandable-underseater-spinner></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Rolling</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Kenneth Cole Reaction Underseater Spinner</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt=Kenneth-cole-reaction-chelsea-luggage-expandable-underseater-spinner style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/IL2_6upr-5_r1nkl5JN1dU9-y0w=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/kenneth-cole-reaction-chelsea-luggage-expandable-underseater-spinner-13cfabfc2974418d8a1bf20133564e3b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Capacity</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Maneuverability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Functionality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0.5><li readability=0><p>This rolling underseat spinner moves super smoothly across the floor thanks to its four 360-degree wheels</p></li><li readability=-1><p>The exterior features an attractive chevron pattern and gold hardware</p></li><li readability=-1><p>There are easily accessible exterior pockets for convenient storage</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Kenneth Cole Reaction Chelsea Underseat Spinner fit two days worth of thick clothes comfortably in our tests, along with shoes and a toiletry bag. Cute and fashionable, the gold hardware creates a nice pop — but the organizational qualities of this bag on the inside are just as great as the exterior, too. Straps on the inside keep your clothes in place, plus there’s a plethora of pockets: two interior stretch pockets, an interior zipper pocket, an exterior pocket on the front, and one on each side.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In our testing, however, the front of the bag bulged with the items inside, giving us a little trouble fitting it under the seat. As with other bags we tested, flipping the bag over did the trick, with the flat side facing up.</p><p>Maneuverability is the biggest selling point on this bag in particular. The bag has four wheels that jut out about two inches from the bottom of the bag and make it extremely easy to roll across airport floors and sidewalks. The ease of maneuverability alone justified the price tag for us, and the aesthetics and compartments were the icing on the cake. Just be aware of over-packing if you don’t want to rely on the overhead compartment.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it’s held up:</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Not only does this spinner work for weekend trips ourselves, but we’ve found it to be incredibly useful when traveling with little ones, too. You can pack it like a diaper bag if you need, or use it for work trips thanks to its professional look. Its surplus of handy compartments helped keep us organized during our travels and the outside pockets made it easy to grab passports, phones, and other essentials as we made our way through stations and terminals. We were pleasantly surprised by how easy it was to steer and roll this mini luggage and breathed a sigh of relief when it fit perfectly under the airplane seat — every time.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 17 x 13 x 9 in. | <strong>Weight:</strong> 5.6 lbs. | <strong>Material</strong>:<strong> </strong>Polyester-twill | <strong>Packing capacity: </strong>Not specified</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-spacious-rockland-melrose-upright-wheeled-underseater-luggage></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Spacious</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Rockland Underseater Luggage</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Rockland Unisex Adults Melrose Upright Wheeled Underseater Luggage" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/3ZH8GETAdAKhafDhjlq2kxkGUik=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/rockland-unisex-adults-melrose-upright-wheeled-underseater-luggage-ac9d5e74cce64289b319f4b3052e37fa.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Capacity</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Maneuverability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Functionality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0.5><li readability=-1><p>This model features a notable amount of interior capacity</p></li><li readability=0><p>There are handy exterior pockets that are helpful for organizing and easily accessing necessities during travel</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Its sturdy material kept the bag from becoming damaged</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In this roomy rolling bag, we packed everything for a short trip with plenty of space to spare. It fit easily under a seat while packed with two pairs of pants, three t-shirts, a bulky sweatshirt, and a pair of heels. The Rockland Melrose bag also features two external pockets and two mesh side pockets, big enough to fit two water bottles.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With a trolley sleeve, soft handles, a big outer compartment with two separate zip mesh pockets, and a tablet-sized sleeve with an elastic strap to secure the contents, this was one of the most well-designed bags that we tested. There’s also a small pocket in front which makes it easy to access your belongings during a flight without taking your whole bag out. The main compartment also has great organization: a plastic pocket for toiletries, four separate sleeves, and a removable mesh pocket.</p><p>Given the roominess and smart design, we were disappointed by the bag’s performance on the maneuverability test. The wheels are inline rather than spinner wheels, so it doesn't take corners well. Pushing the bag vertically was difficult, but it did travel smoothly when we pulled it behind us. Spinners aside, we think this is a great choice for chronic over-packers and organization lovers due to its ample room and smart design.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it’s held up:&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We still love this rolling suitcase after months of testing it on both our weekend getaways and longer travels. We’ve found that we can typically fit three outfits, a pair of shoes, toiletries, and a hair dryer without excessive squeezing, and it fits comfortably under most airplane seats beside the aisle seat (an odd, but recurring experience). Because we’ve used this bag during several trips over the past few months, we were expecting some sort of damage after repeated use — but have yet to discover any unsightly scuffs or fabric deterioration. If you need something extra in addition to your carry-on, then this is a great option for you.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions:</strong> &nbsp;9 x 14 x 15 in. | <strong>Weight:</strong> 3.99 lbs. | <strong>Material</strong>:<strong> </strong>Quilted polyester | <strong>Packing capacity: </strong>Not specified</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-20 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=3840 data-sizes=750px alt="Rockland Melrose Upright Wheeled Underseater Luggage displayed on carpet between shoes and table" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/-Tk5flvZAP-i67Y6pSVNInU0hWk=/fit-in/1500x3840/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/PEO-rockland-melrose-upright-wheeled-underseater-01-Conor-Ralph.jpg-d76118fd2df248b7adc9af45dbc43827.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Conor Ralph</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=3840 data-sizes=750px alt="Person walking on tile floor while pulling Rockland Melrose Upright Wheeled Underseater Luggage" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/2vyMJgjBl1oF19sHrD4hwJJ9V8Y=/fit-in/1500x3840/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/underseat-luggage-test-rockland-melrose-upright-wheeled-underseater-04-Conor-Ralph.jpg-a1ff668245fb4600beaec6605842926b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Conor Ralph</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-tote-travelpro-x-travel--leisure-underseat-tote></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Tote</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Travelpro x Travel + Leisure UnderSeat Tote</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Travelpro x Travel + Leisure UnderSeat Tote" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/vMzyoE1zLInzXABlDpYUDECNNlI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/travelpro-x-travel---leisure-underseat-tote-2fdc4567026f46ff9e43978cc78620d8.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Travelpro</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Capacity</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Maneuverability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Functionality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1.5><li readability=-1><p>This tote features great capacity to store all of the outfits that a busy weekend trip requires</p></li><li readability=2><p>It has tons of practical touches, like a shoulder strap, several pockets, and a luggage sleeve</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It’s a more stylish option than a regular duffle bag thanks to its high-end leather trim</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Are wheels not your thing? Here’s a luxe, yet practical tote bag with tons of space and just the right fit. We fit almost everything that we needed into this bag for a quick weekend away — which consisted of two pairs of pants, two shirts, a jacket, a pair of shoes, and a toiletry bag. Large enough to fit a few days’ worth of clothes, but small enough to slide under the seat, this tote is a clear winner in the underseat luggage category.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-63 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The leather details and optional shoulder strap are nice touches on the tote, which opens up to one large compartment that features two interior pockets — one is a buttoned sleeve, and one is a small zippered pocket. An exterior pocket on the front and a luggage sleeve on the back made it easy to pair this tote with a larger piece of luggage.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We think this bag would be perfect for someone who likes luggage that is functional, but still prefers to travel in style.&nbsp; We would note that there aren’t too many organizational compartments inside, so it would also be good for someone who just wants to throw things in it and go.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-65 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We really only dinged this tote for value.

We love how easy it is to access our computers and how sleek the look of this elevated tote is — making it perfect for our business and leisure travels alike. It’s pretty easy to fit three separate sets of clothing (though we recommend rolling them instead of folding), shoes, hats, even an umbrella, and more in this sleek shoulder bag.

This bag is spacious without being easily weighed down by clothes, which makes it easy to carry around airports and train stations. It was able to house everything we packed with some room to spare: two pairs of pants, two shirts, a jacket, a toiletry bag, a pair of sneakers, and a laptop.

On a larger aircraft with more underseat space, however, we don’t anticipate a fit problem.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-74 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We found this bag to be a good value given its capacity, quality, two carrying options, and multiple zippers and pockets. If you’re someone who’s typically on-the-go and needs a bag that they can mindlessly throw things into, this product is a great option.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-75 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>How it’s held up:</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-76 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In comparison to the backpacks and duffels we’ve used before, this bag takes the cake. From its structured design to its lightweight feel, we’re reaching for this travel tote over everything else in our closets because of how easy it is to take on the go. We’re loving how organized this bag stays because of its several interior and exterior compartments and pockets, and it fits a surprisingly decent amount of clothes (and a professional camera) despite its smaller size. It did end up fitting well under the seat when one of our testers flew across the country for a weekend, which confirmed our inkling about larger planes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-77 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Overall dimensions:</strong> 11 x 18 x 8 in. | <strong>Weight:</strong> 1.6 lbs. | <strong>Material: </strong>Polyester | <strong>Packing capacity: </strong>28 L</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-25 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=3655 data-sizes=750px alt="Travelpro Maxlite 5 Lightweight Underseat Carry-on displayed on carpet with nearby wood table" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/6Vg3Ov7x680XJXdVtObwPKMVLSg=/fit-in/1500x3655/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/PEO-travelpro-maxlite-5-lightweight-underseat-carry-on-travel-tote-bag-01-Conor-Ralph.jpg-573f93cdd10c4f75ae705a5c2370703e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Conor Ralph</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=3840 data-sizes=750px alt="Person sliding Travelpro Maxlite 5 Lightweight Underseat Carry-on on floor underneath a metal cart on wheels" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/VVMMkgKOy7ViVR2y3G_xwgbtWLQ=/fit-in/1500x3840/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/underseat-luggage-test-travelpro-maxlite-5-lightweight-underseat-carry-on-travel-tote-bag-06-Conor-Ralph.jpg-27711462009f4ee3a9e454472b995997.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Conor Ralph</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-versatile-nomad-lane-bento-bag-v-30></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Versatile</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Nomad Lane Bento Bag V 3.0</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Nomad Lane Bento Bag V 3.0" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/8bp__59WqxNtFjgGJzwYp_3xzQk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/nomad-lane-bento-bag-v-30-e0977480161a4a5887cde93c5bff1213.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nomad Lane</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Capacity</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Maneuverability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Functionality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1.5><li readability=1><p>Despite its small, sleek look, this bag can hold quite a lot of items inside</p></li><li readability=-1><p>There are many compartments and pockets to organize your bag with</p></li><li readability=0><p>Includes a luggage sleeve, so you can easily attach it to your carry-on roller bag</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-81 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re planning on investing into an expensive bag, you’ll at least want it to be something versatile enough to go from the airport to the gym, but also tailored enough to be taken into the office. Meet the Nomad Lane Bento Bag V 3.0: a sleek underseat bag that works as a personal item when traveling, but also serves as a gym bag, weekender, or even a daily tote bag. Equipped with several internal compartments, including folder-like sleeves for a computer and important docyments, zippered areas that organize your clothes into sections (think pants on one side, tops on the other), and more. We found that it was easier than ever to keep things in order during our travels with this bag.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-82 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We do wish that the price was just a little lower, seeing as it doesn’t have any special functionalities like wheels or a USB port (like some of the more tech-y luggage pieces), but we do think its sturdy material, compact design, and lightweight body makes this bag one well-worth investing into. With so many different uses, it’s not hard to see how you could incorporate this bag into your everyday life — whether you’re an avid traveler or not. But for short weekend trips away (and for something that is small enough to slide right over your luggage handle while navigating airport terminal), we think this is one of the most versatile options on the market today.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-83 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 17 x 8 x 10 in. | <strong>Weight:</strong> 2.76 lbs. | <strong>Materials</strong>: Nylon, leather | <strong>Packing Capacity</strong>:<strong> </strong>24 L</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-27 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=3840 data-sizes=750px alt="Nomad Lane Bento Bag V 3.0" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/Xi0QjrohtMn5wr6TxCrwKjyof2U=/fit-in/1500x3840/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/underseat-luggage-test-nomad-lane-bento-bag-v3-05-Conor-Ralph.jpg-58271c4fa8144777952e796315bffa68.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Conor Ralph</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=3840 data-sizes=750px alt="Nomad Lane Bento Bag V 3.0" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/3TihMhwvjHpl13oehn26_wTsWWo=/fit-in/1500x3840/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/underseat-luggage-test-nomad-lane-bento-bag-v3-08-Conor-Ralph.jpg-5a598e1747554d149dd22f69089faef0.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Conor Ralph</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-things-to-consider-before-buying-underseat-luggage></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Things to Consider Before Buying Underseat Luggage</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>The Wheel Dilemma</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Underseat luggage is clearly divided into two camps: With wheels, and without. While having wheels on your bag makes the airport a breeze, it’s important to think about how that additional bulk fits under a seat. “You want to consider if having wheels will take up too much space to give you some leg room,” says flight attendant Casey P. Zack. “A smaller tote can be easily ‘scrunched’ to the side more so than a harder material like plastic.” You’ll want to check out something like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Travelpro x Travel + Leisure Underseat Tote</a> or the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="nofollow nocaes">Nomad Lane Bento Bag</a> for a bag like the one Zack describes.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Of course, this is a personal decision, and Janelle Cohen, professional organizer and author of The Folding Book, sees wheels as a priority. “An important feature for any easy trip is four wheels. This makes it super easy to navigate airports and adding a backpack to the handlebar.” Consider our top rolling pick, the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Kenneth Cole Reaction Chelsea Luggage</a>, for a spinner that can fit snugly underneath your seat during your next flight.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Pocket Presence</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Zack also suggests asking this question of underseat luggage: “Does it have multiple pockets for easier access to finding items such as headphones, passport, wallet, and keys?” he asks. This feature is key for many travelers, both in flight, and for keeping belongings organized at your destination. The <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Travelpro Maxlite 5 Lightweight Underseat Carry-on</a> was one of our favorites for its lightweight feel and structured design, but a huge selling point was its many exterior pockets, which made it super easy to grab everything we needed out of it in the security line.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">However, if you’re prone to over-packing, keep in mind that pockets on the outside take away from space on the inside and plan accordingly. “I look for luggage that has no outer pocket because that takes away from the inner storage,” says Cohen. A smooth, hard-backed exterior like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Calpak Hue Mini</a> (our best pick overall) would be a good option if your preference leans toward no-frills designs.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Quality Control</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you prefer a soft bag, check to see if the zipper is dyed to match the bag. “If it is, this is a good sign of quality and that it’s not cheaply made,” says Zack. “It’s also good to check if your items are well kept. If they tend to poke out the fabric too much, this means your bag is cheaply made and could tear easily if packed too tightly.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Professional organizer Eryn Donaldson adds that there are key ways to check a piece of luggage for durability before finding out the hard way. “Looking at things as small as zippers and the fabric quality are important. Look for quality handles and pockets,” she says. Donaldson also recommends checking the zippers to see if they run smoothly, or if they hit a few snags along the way. This should be your initial red flag, as it would most likely only get worse with more use.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Weight</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Donaldson also recommends feeling the weight of the bag while it’s empty. “If the bag feels a bit heavy while empty, it will certainly be heavy once you put your items in it.” The PEOPLE Tested winners range in weight from 1.6 lbs to 6.4 lbs. And while that may not seem like a big range, the measure of a heavy bag is up to the traveler — if you have any doubts about how cumbersome it will be when packed, opt for something lighter.&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Conor Ralph</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-we-tested-underseat-luggage></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How We Tested Underseat Luggage</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We started off our underseat luggage testing by independently measuring the dimensions of each bag to confirm that it meets the average airline’s under-seat dimensions, which we calculated to be 16 x 14 x 9 inches. Next, we evaluated what we’d need for a two-day trip (think a work trip or quick weekend getaway) and packed each piece of luggage accordingly — usually consisting of two different top and bottom combos, a pair of shoes, a toiletry case filled with products, a laptop, and whatever else we’d need. We took note of how well the items fit and if there was any extra room, or if we had to wrestle with the luggage to zip it closed.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The obstacle course was the next step. In order to test how well our rolling luggages could handle twists and turns, we glided through a winding trail carved by obstacle course cones to mimic corners and the foot traffic that comes with weaving through airport crowds. Each of our selected luggages held up handsomely.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">After this, we arrived at our “gate.” Each luggage was placed into a standard size underseat area which we sat about 12 inches behind in chairs, noting how easy or difficult it was to slide the bag into the space.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Finally, we rated each piece of luggage on the following attributes: capacity (Can it accommodate a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>packing cube</a>?), design, functionality, and maneuverability. After scoring each bag in those categories, we learned the retail price of the luggage and then rated its value.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">But there’s only so much travel you can simulate in a lab without testing the real thing. Thus, we sent our luggages away with our team of testers to take with them on their upcoming travels. For up to six months, the majority of our winning bags were taken across the country in order to test how well they really stand up against frequent travel, different airlines, and even long-distance trains to see how versatile (and underseat-friendly) these bags were.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We later updated this list with that information to bring you the most up-to-date (and realistic) feedback that we can, so you can make more informed decisions when it comes time for your next luggage purchase.&nbsp;<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-faq-1e783cef-a90c-4ba2-ae5e-3cf2d4b45437></span><p>Frequently Asked Questions</p><ul id=mntl-sc-block-faq__content_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-faq__content mntl-accordion" readability=49.772754312909><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>What size luggage fits under airplane seats?</span></p><p>At PEOPLE Tested, we used these average dimensions for an underseat compartment: 16 x 14 x 9 inches.

And by the way, companies can never buy our recommendation: Their products must earn it, fair and square.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In short, PEOPLE Tested provides recommendations you can trust — every day, every purchase.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5KawLV51Kebnqqjmq61ecuunqCZl5p6d4OTa2hsaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbest-underseat-luggage-6742130.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbest-underseat-luggage-6742130.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbest-underseat-luggage-6742130.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbest-underseat-luggage-6742130.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbest-underseat-luggage-6742130.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbest-underseat-luggage-6742130.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./ujsmei6glxstqsw2k7ror9ykh2inqwny.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./ujsmei6glxstqsw2k7ror9ykh2inqwny.html>Watch Criminal Minds Season 7 Episode 6: Epilogue</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./nene-leakes-flaunts-ageless-bikini-body.html>NeNe Leakes Flaunts &amp;quot;Ageless&amp;quot; Bikini Body</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./nene-leakes-flaunts-ageless-bikini-body.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
